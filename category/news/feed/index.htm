										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright and early Monday morning, August 14, 2023, Northwest High school welcomed our freshmen. There were 367 freshmen students who were navigating the halls, learning about the school’s culture and schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first week of school is different for everyone- freshmen are transitioning and rushing around trying to figure out the hallway system and how to be a high school student. Freshman Casey Stuart said the beginning of the year was an adjustment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was cool, kind of a bit boring. Awkward, though, because no one wanted to talk in class,” Stuart said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ike Childs said Northwest was better than his previous school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was pretty good, a lot calmer. Not as many fights surprisingly,” Childs said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One big difference, the freshmen have noticed, between high school and middle school is block scheduling and time difference. Here at Northwest, class periods are 80 minutes long, which some students were finding hard to get used to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“..classes aren’t too hard. Just longer periods and that’s annoying,” Childs said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change from middle school is lunch organization, everyone going at the same time. A benefit that seemed popular is being able to hang out with different grades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like being able to hang out with upperclassmen since there’s not many cool freshmen,” Childs said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;The SRG grading system is a grading scale that has been increasingly used in classes. It is a system used by our teachers to help kids on their behalf with their understanding of the subject or even unit.&nbsp; But here at Northwest High School the grading system is reverting back to how it normally was a few years ago.</span></p>
<p>Part of the reason for the change was general confusion.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;“A lot of kids didn’t understand the grading part of SRG which made our students not like it and made them even more uninterested in the grading system,”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> Principal Eric Hofer-Holdeman said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;According to assistant principal Hammond “We are still using the SRG planning system for assignments.”&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some teachers and students said it gives a better understanding of the assignment and for students to know the exact detail within the topic or unit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The power law was a big part in why some believed SRG was taken away from Northwest. The power laws weighted later assignments heavier than assignments from earlier in the semester.&nbsp; </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">USD 259 is preparing students to be successful in college and more, with having SRG for students a while back that did not use our SRG weren’t prepared for the grading system in college and other educational fields according to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Assistant Principal Charlie Bartsch, </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“In college they don’t use SRG which would make USD 259 goals no where they are wanting them too. While now at Northwest we can prepare students for their next level of education and help them achieve their goals,”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Bartsch said. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Students at Northwest were happy with this change, CJ Mertes (12) was one of the students that were happy with this change. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“I was happy with this change because it felt like it would bring my grade down and cause me to have stress about what my grades were,” Mertes said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tragedy strikes! One of the biggest parts of the school is now closed for reconstruction. A little back story on the reason the pool is closed, the far wall from the entrance of the Physical Education hall was rotting away near the windows, to the point where it became unsafe for people to be in that room until it&#8217;s repaired.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the students are very disappointed by the closing of the pool taking several of the fun things about the physical side of the school away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s like my freshman year all over again, not being able to use the pool for swim team or aquatics class,” Gabriel Bickham (12) said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assistant Swim Team Coach Tiffany Houle said the lack of a home pool might make things harder to recruit athletes for the team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “With the pool closed a difficulty I could see is the younger swimmers having a hard time traveling to West to have practice leading to the possibility of several swimmers not coming out for the team,” Houle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As follows, several students say they won&#8217;t have time or energy to travel to a different school for practice every single day.</span></p>
<p>The sudden closing of the pool create other issues too.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It definitely took everyone by surprise and the school made a quick turn around to combat the closing of the pool, getting rid of aquatics class and changing the curriculum for several classes involving the use of the pool. It&#8217;s a very unfortunate situation and it causes a hard shift for classes and sports teams of the Northwest, &#8221; Principal Eric Hofer-Holdeman said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;At this moment, no one knows when it will be back up and running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”We were told that the pool wouldn&#8217;t be open for the rest of the year, but we hope that by next school year it will be back in operation,&#8221; Houle said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There have already been many people for the school district coming and looking at the pool, deciding on whether to tear the whole section of that building down or just that room. For now, all that can be said is it is unsafe for anyone to be in that room unsupervised.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">A pungent smell invades the nostrils of Abby Fickle as she frantically grabs the keepsakes from her car. A sense of urgency seems to drown out the chaos, she grabs the last of her things that she can get at this moment and takes off. Away from her precious car as it is engulfed in flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Abby Fickle, a junior at Northwest who loved her car, a Volkswagen Beetle nicknamed Spike, an astronomical amount. For Abby and her friend Tianna Piña it was a fairly normal lunch at the start of a new year. They had just gotten into Abby’s car and had attempted to turn on the air conditioning. It turned on but both of them noticed a sliver of smoke emerging from the controls. At this point in time they still drove it around this is where the first signs of trouble started appearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The smell started becoming something very very strong to the point where you could feel it inside your stomach and made you grossed out,” Tianna Piña, (11), said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">After a while things started picking up, according to Tianna and Abby. The smoke grew darker black and increased in quantity. The stench carried by it became even more gut-wrenching at this point in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The black smoke kind of reminded me of a house fire, but luckily we were just in a car, so we could get out safely,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the black smoke started sweeping through her car, Fickle drove back to school grounds. Thinking quickly, Fickle drove her car into the parking lot away from other vehicles, calling her dad for advice and help. They opened up the hood and in the process discovered the fire on the side of her car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“He told us to disconnect the cable from the battery just in case that would help, and as I rounded the corner of the car we saw the fire fuming,” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the fire raged on, the windows were the first to break due to the intense heat. After that,&nbsp; Fickle and Piña were escorted away from the vehicle and into the nurse’s office. There the realization of what had truly happened hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“What was going through my mind was&nbsp; something that was new to me, and I don’t know why I reacted this way, but I started laughing,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">While Piña felt hysteria, Fickle understandably felt pure sadness not only that, but also she had endured a borderline traumatic experience. At the nurse’s office both were found to be healthy, despite all circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“I kept getting reminded by dad whenever I was sad about it, that if I had done anything different we both could have died, or something worse could have happened” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">The car itself was totaled, a large portion of it completely destroyed by flames. Fickle only had liability insurance though, leaving her without a vehicle at this moment, but Fickle does have plans to bring back some life back into an old mustang her sister owned.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“It’s weird, a change, but we worked on it all day and now I drive that,” Fickle said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;Devious Licks&#8221; trend popularized on TikTok, is causing hardship for both students and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having to clean up everything that students have ruined is very difficult for all the staff. Replacing things that have been stolen takes money away that could be used for other things. Staff members say that this trend is childish and it needs to stop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is very frustrating as a school administrator to put up with the needless vandalism,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the thought of somebody putting this out there on TikTok as the devious licks trend…motivates students to vandalize their own school. We don’t have a choice but to shut them down to repair and clean up,” Principal Eric Hofer-Holdeman said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Many students are tired of the inconveniences resulting from the theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I used to go to a school where we didn’t have toilet paper, soap and nothing. The fact they’re taking it away is making me a little bit uncomfortable. Some of my friends said someone stole a urinal and I didn’t understand until I saw it on tikTok and then I actually saw someone take warning signs,” Fabiola Finol-Colina (10) said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with stealing things, students are also destroying property and basic necessities. Jimmie Belden, custodian, says it makes his job harder trying to replace everything on a daily basis. Tiffany Hampe, math,&nbsp;also agrees that the trend is “ridiculous”. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; When it comes to politics, most topics can cause disagreement. Whether students like it or not, most topics ignite a political disagreement, from how one may dress, to what bathroom one decides to use. Politics are all around and in fact it has become a relevant discussion at Northwest. Every year seniors are allowed to paint a parking spot with a design that makes them happy. What was supposed to be a light hearted, fun event has turned into a political disagreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were three political statement parking designs that lit a heated discussion. One read “Trump 2024, I’ll be back”, another was a design of the Blue Lives Matter flag, and the third was an American flag with the statement, ‘Don’t Tread on Me’.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;For those who do not know, the Blue Lives Matter flag is a statement in the United States advocating that those who are prosecuted and convicted of killing law enforcement officers should be sentenced under hate crime statutes. As for ‘Don&#8217;t Tread on Me&#8217;, while its origins may be less controversial, the phrase in the present day has raised far more political discussions. Although the statement tends to be viewed as a more conservative statement, for many the saying “Don’t Tread on Me” can be interpreted in all sorts of different ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caleb Sidener, senior painted the “Trump 2024 : I’ll be back” flag alongside his girlfriend,&nbsp; senior MacKenzie Haney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew the controversy was going to happen. It was obviously going to happen considering what we painted, plus it covered both spots. It doesn’t really bother me, people have the right to hate it; as long as they don’t vandalize it then I don’t really care,” Sidener said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haney, senior, explained that after seeing a ‘Black Lives Matter’ parking spot designed by a senior last year she felt that they should design a spot to show that there is diversity in opinions, but she was upset by the reactions they faced by friends and the community around them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can clearly see where people would be offended by it. We knew there was going to be some controversy but we also think there is a little maturity that should come with the acceptance that there are other viewpoints and people should have tried to get to understand our viewpoints better than labelling what they saw on the parking spot,” Haney said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chloe Hoyt, a junior, has an opposing view to the spots. Hoyt feels that the spot was rooted out of hate towards opposing views and should be removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think that one [Black Lives Matter spot] was rooted out of hate, but I think the other ones were, because they knew what they were doing and they stated that it was rooted out of hate. So I don’t think that one should be covered up,” Hoyt said&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandria Butler, senior, is very passionate about the controversy regarding the parking spots.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“Honestly, with the whole duration of time that has been set between COVID and coming back in person, people have changed a lot. So I feel like between those times of not being able to see how these people change, a lot can be sparked up or viewpoints can be switched or things can be brought to light. </span></p>
<p>Butler thinks more specific guideline might prevent future controversies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being more mindful and aware of things like that and putting a rule onto it, especially students that are young and don’t really understand all the things that they talk about. So try to get more rules on what is painted on a parking spot, because if there is no regulation on that, then they can offend a lot of people, hurt a lot of people and also say a lot of harm to people,” Butler&nbsp; said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After lots of controversy regarding the parking spots, the school decided to keep them as is and not let them get painted over. The school made this decision based on the First Amendment.&nbsp;</span></p>
