										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y.E, Youth Entrepreneurs, is a class Northwest offers to Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. The class teaches students the basics of starting and running a business, this includes the learning of COGS, revenue streams, business plans, etc. There are currently two classes of Y.E at Northwest, one ran by Chris Lambert and the other ran by Gavin Darr. The class to say the least requires a lot of effort for the students, so last year after everything was said and done both teachers pooled together and formed a game to reward students for all of their hard work. They decided that a kickball match would be held between the two classes in order to give them a fun way to wind down. However this would have the unintentional effect of creating a sort of joking rivalry between Darr and Lambert after Darr’s team won the first year of kickball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year Lambert was determined to win and so when the game commenced he hyped up his class. Running them through rules, and just ensuring that&nbsp; above all else they were having fun. Since Lambert had lost the previous year, his team was up to kick first. They got off to a phenomenal start as the first kicker slammed the ball across the field. Allowing for the first kicker to make it straight to second base.&nbsp; The game continued with a back and forth pattern, one team would score 2 or 3 points the other team would score 1-2.&nbsp; By the middle of the match Darr&#8217;s team was 2 point behind Lambert&#8217;s, and the pressure was kept up. The next kicker, and first of his inning, Johnny Huynh hit a straight shot right through the defenses of Darr’s team. Allowing Lambert&#8217;s team to get a free home-run, driving the score up by one more. Momentum from there continued and it seemed like the match had been settled.&nbsp; In the end Lambert held their lead and won the 2nd Annual Y.E Kickball game with a final score of 9-7. Although Darr’s team lost, both teams enjoyed themselves with lots of laugh and overall positive energy in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d say overall it was pretty fun and very engaging, it was a good way to end off the year,” said Sam Hohman student Lambert&#8217;s class.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wrestling has begun their season, with many new participants this year. To kick off the season Northwest went head-to-head against each other to get a feel of what this season is going to look like. Each participant went against someone who is in their wright group or around the same weight. This was a great way to see the potential of the wrestling team this year.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest the past couple of years have had a good group of wide receivers to throw to. With many receivers leaving, others have had to step up. The Northwest receiver core is expected to be explosive and show signs of great speed. The receiving squad has built a nice core with many returning players expected to have bigger roles. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trenton Salisbury (11) has shown great potential and sees himself getting many reps and being a consistent target. Randall Bell (12) who used to play quarterback then switched to receiver is very excited for the new season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“The way we’re able to adjust this year, and mess with the defense will make us really nice this year,” Bell stated when asked about his wide receiver group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Michael Lopez, who is the receivers coach&#8217;s son, is expected to have a big role on the team this year. Many of his teammates have said his speed is incredible and has explosive acceleration. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kealis Miles has another bright spot in the receiving core. His broad body type and athletic skills will make him a force on the Grizzlies offense. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asking Miles some of his personal goals this year he stated “I want to overall become a better blocker for my teammates, so I can be as two dimensional as possible. And I want to have a reception each game of the season.” Miles is a great example of a team player and the Grizzlies are glad to have him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the season starting very soon, fans and students will be able to see all of what the receivers can put on the table.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">Athletes often say that their team feels like a family, but for this year&#8217;s varsity volleyball team, it was more than a feeling. The team had something happen to them that has never occurred before. This year there are three pairs of sisters all playing for the girls’ varsity volleyball team ranging all the way from freshman to senior. </span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Freshman Camdyn </span><span data-contrast="none">Stucky said her bond with her sister, junior Caiya Stucky has deepened by having her as a teammate.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;“W</span><span data-contrast="none">e have</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;been&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">close</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;our whole lives but being on the high school volleyball team brings something&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">totally new</span><span data-contrast="none">. Our relationship has grown so much, and I am so thankful for that,</span><span data-contrast="none">” Camdyn said.</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;Camdyn said she values this volleyball seas</span><span data-contrast="none">on since it is one of two that she gets to spend alongside her sister. The other sibling sets on the team were also very positive about how this experience impacts their relationships</span><span data-contrast="none">. They all mentioned that if all of them did not play for the same team, they felt as if the bond of the whole team had would have drastically changed. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;“</span><span data-contrast="auto">Having these sisters on our team definitely makes practices and honestly all of our time together so much more fun. Our whole team has grown to become family,</span><span data-contrast="auto">” sophomore Daetyn Bogle said.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Daetyn</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and her sister </span><span data-contrast="auto">Brailee</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Bogle both play for the varsity team. The both agreed that their connection is on another level since they have been playing together for five years. The sisters said they think the amount of time they have played together helps them understand each other on and off the court. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The other set of siblings on the team this year are the Corcoran sisters, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Jacqueline</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jaicee</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Jacqueline</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;is a&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">freshman</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;while her si</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto">ter&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jaicee</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;is a senior.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jacqueline said she was grateful for the board of education&#8217;s decision to allow fall sports so that she didn&#8217;t lose her only chance to be on the team with Jaicee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">The best thing about having my sister on the team is knowing&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">there is always&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">someone</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;to push you and knowing that we can’t take this season for granted. We didn’t think we would get to play at first and that made both&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jaicee</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and I really upset knowing this is our only year to get to play together, so when we got our season back we knew that we had to make it special.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The team ended their season as sub-state champions and in the top eight of the state in the 6A category with a record of 14-2. According to coach Adriana Leake, all of the other teams at state had gotten to play over 30 games this season while Northwest had played fewer games due to the late start for their season.</span></p>
<p>Leake said having sisters really modeled to the rest of the team how they could have strong disagreements, as siblings sometimes do, but then come back together. And she appreciated the increased communication.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nice because in a lot of ways the team chemistry was already built in,&#8221; Leake said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> 	The BOE members of Wichita public schools made a heartbreaking announcement to cancel all fall sports activities in August. This decision came with great sadness and anger for many student athletes as well as parents from schools all over Wichita including usd 259 surrounding schools such as Maize, Andover ,Maize South etc. Only a few days later many people were forming plans to protest the decision to get their sports back that they had been working for all summer long and days after the BOE reversed their decision and brought fall sports back, here’s what motivated them to change their minds.</p>
<p> 	Some students were feeling more confused and angered than others about the decision cancelling fall sports. Many felt the decision was unfair and did not make sense because every other district in Kansas was following through with fall sports to give their student athletes a chance. Kylee Robertson, a Junior on the varsity cheerleading team felt very bothered by the original decision made.  </p>
<p>  “What bothered me the most about this decision was that every school district around Wichita public schools was going through with fall sports and we were one of the few that got it taken away without even being given a chance to prove that we will follow all safety precautions which we had been doing all summer during conditioning,” said Robertson. </p>
<p> 	When the BOE made this decision they had no idea what was about to happen. They received backlash from all social media platforms including, coaches, parents, students from Wichita public schools and schools from all over and many more people who just wanted the student athletes to be given a chance at a season. Less than a week after their decision, students in sports and band and students who just wanted to see their friends have the season they worked for, were getting together to form protests. There were protests held at Northwest and at North in hopes of changing the BOE members. </p>
<p>Camden Aldrich, a senior football player attended the protests after mourning the fact that he may no longer be having a senior football season. </p>
<p>“I don’t think that the BOE took into consideration what this decision did to the seniors. It took away scholarship opportunities and it took away some people&#8217;s last time to ever be on the field. Many of the people out there have been playing [football] since they were younger and this was their last year and they just took it away from them without giving them a chance,” said Aldrich before hearing that sports were back.	</p>
<p>Days after the decision that ended fall sports the BOE held a meeting that reversed their decision. The BOE made the choice to allow fall sports with precautions. These precautions consisted of no visitors being allowed to attend games, all students participating in high risk sports must attend school through my school remote, players must wear their masks on the sidelines and this decision included a few more smaller precautions. </p>
<p>	“This decision made us all feel accomplished and it made us feel like our voices were finally heard by the BOE members and they for once took our opinions into consideration,” Aldrich said after hearing the decision that sports were back on.</p>
<p>	After hard work forming protests and emailing board members, student athletes and their fans felt like their hard work had paid off. Many felt accomplished and felt that their voices were heard for once. What could potentially happen in the future with sports and COVID may be undetermined but these students will play their sports and cheer on their fellow student athlete friends until a potential change in the future. </p>
