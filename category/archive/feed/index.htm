<p>Star signs, everyone has one yet not everybody knows what they mean. Overall horoscopes are supposed to represent how a person acts in everyday life. Take into example a person who is a Taurus (April 19-May 20), they are supposed to be stubborn yet at the same time be artistic and overall enjoy a luxurious life. On the other hand, there are the Libras (September 22-0ctober 22), these people are supposed to be well balanced as well as charming. The star sign often being represented by a scale.</p>
<p>The big question is: Do the students at Northwest relate to their horoscopes?</p>
<p>Lea-cher Kennedy, freshman, said that she does not know much about star signs therefore she does not have a clear answer to them.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in them too much, but there are certain coincidences where I’ll be reading something about my horoscope and be like, “Hey, that actually does sound like me,” Kennedy said.</p>
<p>Bethany Cortus, senior, said that from the little she does know about her sign, she does feel like she relates to it.</p>
<p>“I would consider myself a little like my sign. We share similar characteristics, as in being caring and having a sensitive soul. Although from there I would think that we are not very alike,” Cortus said.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous two students, Pranav Prasad, freshman, does know a lot about his sign. Pranav said that he was a Libra. He feels like his sign does describe him well.</p>
<p>“I am a social whirl, like how people from my horoscope tend to be. It can be a good thing or a bad thing, but I take it as a good thing. I am also a very loyal person, so in the end, Prasad said. &#8220;Yes, I do believe I relate to my horoscope.”</p>
<p>Star signs are an interesting thing to look at. Many do not know what a star sign is until they look it up for themselves. If you have not read about yours, why not do it? See if you relate to one of the students above.</p>
<p>“I think everybody should read about their horoscope; I didn’t know much about mine until recently, but they are pretty interesting,” Kennedy said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Christmas less than a month away, people of all ages are starting up their annual Christmas traditions. Whether it’s with family, friends or significant others, seemingly everyone has some sort of holiday tradition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Hofhine spends her time bonding with her siblings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every Christmas Eve, me and my little siblings build a tent out of blankets and sheets and whatever we can find,” Hofhine said. “We put lights up around it in the living room and we all sleep in the tent.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to hanging out with siblings, Ameara Clark gets to visit another relative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I go to my aunt’s house on Christmas Eve every year,” Clark said. “She’ll make a big dinner (I get a WHOLE pan of green bean casserole for myself) and we&#8217;ll trade white elephant gifts and eat cake balls.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesley Buser also has exciting traditions involving food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In normal years, my grandma holds a gingerbread house decorating party with homemade houses, cookies, sandwiches, soups, and then holiday ice cream,” Buser said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America isn’t the only one with Christmas traditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British kids are well acquainted with Father Christmas, Santa Claus or Saint Nick, but they can consider themselves lucky they don&#8217;t live in Austria, where a ghoulish creature called &#8216;Krampus&#8217;, the evil accomplice of St Nicholas, is said to wander the streets in search of badly-behaved children. During the month of December you can expect to see terrifying masked figures out and about scaring kids and adults alike with ghastly pranks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unusual tradition comes from Iceland, where a giant cat is said to roam the snowy countryside at Christmas time. Traditionally farmers would use the Yule Cat as an incentive for their workers &#8211; those who worked hard would receive a new set of clothes, but those who didn&#8217;t would be devoured by the gigantic cat-like beast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this year, most cannot celebrate Christmas like they’re used to, because of Covid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how the Coronavirus has impacted Chesley Buser’s Christmas traditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So my grandpa&#8217;s birthday is Christmas Eve and we normally have a bunch of parties to celebrate him and of course Christmas,&#8221; Buser said &#8220;We have a bunch of my family come down but this year it will just be my immediate family of me, my sister, mom, dad, mama, and papa. It will definitely be smaller but I hope that by next year things will be better,&#8221; Buser said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Altgilbers is a freshman at Northwest high school who enjoys academics. He enjoys academics&nbsp; like history, drama, reading, and even studying things like military and politics. He has his thoughts on Trump, music, and movies like everyone else.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers listens country music and likes it over other music. He has a disliking for modern music. Altgilbers states modern music is artificial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Modern music just seems excessively artificial to me” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers likes to read, learn about history, do drama, study military on the weekends, and meatloaf. He enjoys drama because he enjoys putting on theater. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The class I am most interested in is drama because I very much enjoy putting on theatre,” Altigilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like everyone else, Altgilbers has his thoughts on politics and Trump himself. He thinks Trump isn’t good at what he does but has some good points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thoughts on Trump are that he&#8217;s really not good at anything he does, unless he&#8217;s creating chaos. He&#8217;s very good at that. Some more thoughts on Trump are that he was pretty competent as a businessman, but not as a president,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers is a fan of Star Trek and there is one movie he prefers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Star Trek VI is my favorite movie because it has my favorite things and tells a great story with them: sci-fi, diplomacy, and rogue generals.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traveling for the Holidays?</p>
<p>Traveling is one of the many enjoyable things people like to do during the holidays. The question is: Is it safe to travel? This year has been a harsh one, especially with the world-wide pandemic going around. Now with the holidays steadily approaching families are faced with the tough decision that is traveling.</p>
<p>Following what the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) says if you do plan to travel, do it wisely. Consider your community. If there are cases spiking it is best not to travel. Another thing to take into consideration would be where you are traveling to. See if there are coronavirus cases spiking there. This is because airports, bus stations, train stations, public transports, and many other public places are prone to be exposed to the virus. Either it is on the surface or in the air. If you do still plan to travel these are the best things to take into consideration: Wear a mask in public settings, avoid close contact with anyone, wash your hands regularly, avoid touching your face, and finally stand 6 feet apart from people. Overall, the CDC says that the best option is to stay home. It is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>What does this mean for Kansas? This recent week Kansas has seen a massive spike of coronavirus cases. Amounting to an average of 2,439 new cases per day. What do the people at Northwest think?</p>
<p>Crystal Kerr, science, said her family has decided not to visit this Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They are better able to distance, but cases in the community are very high right now. We have been about as careful with safety precautions as we can, but I don’t want to accidentally transmit something to others.”</p>
<p>Kerr said that she believes that even if that does mean she can&#8217;t see her family, she would rather them remain safe and healthy.</p>
<p>What do the students at Northwest think? Matthew Altgilbers freshman, said it&#8217;s not a clear cut decision.</p>
<p>“It all depends on the destination. If you have been exposed to people within the two weeks of travel, do not travel.” He went on to say that if you do end up traveling to take all the precautions into consideration in order to be able to be in a safe environment.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this year has been a tough one but if people are safe there can be brighter holidays ahead.</p>
<p>“It is sad, but I feel like it is the right decision,” Kerr said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 has been different and not what everyone had planned. There is one thing right now that people are debating over and that is Trick or treating. Should kids go? Should kids stay home? What are some other options? Everyone has their own opinions on these questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to COVID-19 we have to take proper precautions to stay safe like social distancing, wearing mask, constantly using hand sanitizer, and staying inside. These things we have to do to stay safe is messing with Trick or Treating. It isn’t possible to Trick or treat and do what its necessary to stay safe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angie Rodriguez-Guzman, a freshman, has her opinions on why kids shouldn&#8217;t trick or treat this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I personally do not think kids should trick or treat this Halloween. Though candy is in packages it&#8217;s still unsafe because the outside of those packages is still being touched by the person giving out. Kids are going door to door breathing in air that isn&#8217;t safe,” Guzman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Altgilbers is another freshman at Northwest who has opinions on Trick or treating in 2020. He believes that it’s not safe and kids should stay indoors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do not think that kids should trick or treat this year. It&#8217;s definitely not safe, children are irresponsible and don&#8217;t wear masks willingly,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While trick or treating isn’t safe parents will still go to let their kids have some fun since 2020 has been a rough year. Guzman said that even though trick or treating isn’t safe there are a few things parents could do to make it a little safer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they do trick or treat, always wear a mask even under your own if you have a mask costume. Best to wear gloves, and before stepping into the house either leave the costume outside or spray disinfectant spray on it before stepping into your home for everyone&#8217;s safety. I also think spraying the candy wrappers with disinfectant before touching them is a good idea,” Guzman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safest thing to do on Halloween this year is to stay indoors. Guzman and Altgilbers both have a few alternate options to do instead of trick or treating. Guzman said you could trick or treat in the house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ Dressing up is still always an option but staying home is the safest. You can do a trick or treat in your own home, decorate it for spooky season, bring your family together, and trick or treat from room to room,” Guzman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Halloween will be different this year it will definitely be something for the books. Halloween will be celebrated differently but memories will be made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As for what parents could do to keep it safe, just keep the kiddos in and buy them some candy. Instead of going out, they could stay in and watch a movie,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
