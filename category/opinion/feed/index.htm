										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Northwest High School’s main priority has always been to protect their students. In the past few years, we have seen many ways this has been updated and enforced. For example, checking ID’s at football games and our recent safety feature from last year, the metal detectors. The newest addition we have is the policy that we must wear our ID’s on school lanyards while being inside of the school.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my other years of attending Northwest, you always had to receive an ID. It had a few main purposes like scanning the barcode for breakfast in the morning and giving solid proof that you were an upperclassman so you could get back into the school during lunch. Now it’s purpose is to ensure that you’re a student at the school, not a random person wandering the hallways. Continuously wearing the ID was created as a policy because of the increased amount of dangers happening inside of schools over the past few years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it can be seen as a way to keep students and staff safe inside of the school, it has proven to have many faults as well. A main issue with the new policy is the fact that if you happen to forget your ID at home one day, you must go to security and buy a new one. This can be incredibly inconvenient for some if they happen to be running late, they’d have to stand in a line to get themselves another ID. This also brings up the problem of money issues and not being able to buy yourself a new one every time you accidentally forget yours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another disadvantage with the ID system is that they can be incredibly uncomfortable which causes many disturbances. The lanyard material can scratch against your neck, or be pulled if it’s accidentally caught on something. There’s also been instances of the lanyard getting stuck in long amounts of hair, and that’s never fun to untangle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly though, the central problem regarding the ID’s is always having to wear them around our necks. Having them in our hands seems like it’d be obvious that we do go to the school. So when teachers consistently tell us in the hallway to put them on, it can seem pointless.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are quite a few things that could be taken into account to make the system easier for both parties. For instance, allowing the students the choice to bring their own type of lanyard. That could fix the issue of discomfort, seeing as you could choose your own material. Another solution could potentially be giving a little more leniency towards people who do forget their ID. Just like with tardies, you’re given a few free passes before it’s a lunch detention, that system could be tested with the IDs. So while many dislike this new policy, there’s several ways to update the conditions so that both the student body and faculty are content, and our safety is ensured.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addams Family</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site:DVD</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 1991</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: 5/5&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: The Addams family is a classic movie that I enjoy watching at any point in the year but especially enjoy around Halloween. This movie is definitely an easy to follow movie but gives off creepy vibes. If you enjoy watching this then I highly recommend watching the Addams Family values.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hocus Pocus</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: DisneyPlus&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 1993</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: 4/5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This is a classic movie to watch during the spooky season and is interesting as the plot is based on older times. It is kind of spooky but it is still appropriate for most ages.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Halloween Town</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: DisneyPlus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 1998</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating:&nbsp; 5/5&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: Halloween town is a classic halloween movie that can be watched by all ages. There are four halloween town movies and they all correlate with each other. The halloweentown series is a good series to binge watch on during a cool fall day.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coraline</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Amazon prime video</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 2009&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: 3/5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: Although Coraline is a good movie with the editing and detail put into every scene, it still scares me so much to this day at 17 years old. I do think Coraline has a very interesting plot and would be an amazing movie to watch if I was not as terrified but until I become less scared I will keep the rating at a 3.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nightmare before Christmas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: DisneyPlus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 1993</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: 4/5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: Tim Burton movies are always classic movies to watch during halloween. The only reason I would give this movie a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the fact that it kind of has to do with Christmas a little bit. But if you are wanting to watch a more halloween movie by Tim Burton I would highly recommend watching Frankenweenie.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases when people sign up for things, they expect them to be easy and simple and that is because of society glamorizing and only showing what people want to see. Advertisers may show the good and don’t think to mention the challenges of these activities till it’s too late, so the people watching or listening play into the challenges that it has with what’s being advertised.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some activities that may take more effort than students expect include AVID, ECA, theatre groups, book clubs, and other extracurricular activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something to keep in mind is that everything takes work. The thing to note is how much effort you’re willing to put into something to get the desired outcome. For example, you get into a program that will help you out in the long run with college but the thing you forget is the effort it takes to stay in the program. Most times people just seem to stop and give up when things get difficult because we as adults and children are told by the people with more power or knowledge that it is okay, however is not the only reason. When it comes to school, most students seem to focus better in the actual classroom. Some students end up dropping out because they don’t see a point in what they are being told to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the students are pushing themselves to make it through school even though it’s online and may be more difficult to focus. These students show everyone in the long run that no matter how tough things get, putting in the effort is important. Students who start small and build themselves up and become leaders are the people who send positive messages to the ones that are scared to start from nothing. These people are life changers in one way or another, and that’s something important to realize. Signing up and getting accepted into something thinking it is going to be easy because that’s how it seems is the wrong mindset to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into something having the wrong mindset can easily lead to failure. High school and college students tend to drop out for multiple reasons. Some learners may feel they are too far behind academically to catch up and feel as if they don’t have their teachers by their side, while others may have problems at home. Whatever the reason, many support systems exist such as counselors, after-school groups, tutoring in-school and out of school tutoring, and teachers to help students stay in school and earn diplomas or degrees; most students just won’t reach out to those support systems to know they are there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to realize what you’re signing up for and why you are doing it whether that may be for money, an education, or just for fun. People are watching you in public when you make a bold move, you could be a life-changer too.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to Covid-19 people are required to wear mask in a public place. There are still people who refuse to wear a mask in the store. It’s a requirement but every once and a while you&#8217;ll see people without a mask. Do they have a point to not wear one? What should happen to them? Is there other things mask can do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a requirement to wear masks in public whether someone’s at a gas station, the store, or a restaurant. Mask may not make a person immune to Covid-19 but it helps lower the risk of them getting it. It helps keep people safe and healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people who don’t wear mask when they are supposed to I feel like there should be proper action taken. I feel if someone doesn’t wear a mask in a public place, anyone who works there should ask them calmly to wear a mask or leave. If they refuse to leave they should be denied service. Now if someone starts causing a huge scene the worker should just leave them alone to stop any possible physical confrontation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who don’t wear mask should really look at the unnecessary trouble they are causing. For the thirty minuets of wearing a mask in a store isn’t bad if its helping keep people safe from the pandemic. Wearing a mask is not only helping you but others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask can do more than help keep you safe from a pandemic. Mask can help keep your face warm in the winter. Little kids who have allergies don’t quite understand how important it is to sneeze in your arm or tissue. So wearing a mask can help block that sneeze. Wearing a mask can help in so many different ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask is important and if people refuse to there should be proper precautions taken.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candy cane lane</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: N Azure circle, Wichita, KS 67235</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information: This a cul-de-sac that all goes together to decorate their houses with tons of Christmas decorations. Each house has their own displays and they also have a radio station where you can listen to Christmas music while looking at the lights. If you want to go be prepared to wait in a long line of cars!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: I would give this a 3.5. I would give it this rating because not everyone in the cul-de-sac had their houses decorated and it kind of sucked waiting in a 30 minutes line just to see the lights for like 4 minutes. The radio station also did not work well; it was very static and choppy sounding. Other than that the decorations were amazing and so much amazing work went into this.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reindeer road</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: N Firefly St, Wichita, KS 67235&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information: Reindeer road is a street right next to candy cane lane. Each yard that participates in the holiday decorations has a large reindeer in their yard ranging from 9-15 feet tall. If you go to this street be prepared to wait in a long line!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: I would rate this a 4. I really liked how they had reindeers in their yard to go with the reindeer road theme. Like the candy cane lane it was kind of sad that there were multiple houses that did not decorate or had minimum decoration and it was also a very long wait just to drive by it very fast.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christmas at the Mckinneys’</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: 1452 N Coolidge, Wichita, KS 67203</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information: Christmas at the Mckinneys’ is a family who decorates their yard every year with 150,000 lights! They also share their decorations with their neighbors yard. All of the lights go with radio station 89.7 where the lights go to the music making an amazing light show! This is a free thing to see but donations are accepted. All of the donations go to the Kansas Humane Society and HumanKind.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: I would rate this a 5. There is literally nothing bad I can say about this light show. There was not a long line, the music was good and the lights were outstanding! This was an amazing place to go see lights and I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone!</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9th street lights</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: 3821 W 9th St, Wichita, KS 67203</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information: 9th street lights have more than 35,000 lights paired up with radio station 101.7 to make an amazing light show of lights that go with the music. They play many classic songs that all of their lights go to!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: I would give this light show a 4.5 rating. I would only take .5 off because I wish I was in a better spot to experience everything better. Overall it was an amazing experience and I would definitely go back again! It was a smaller house with a huge light show that was very entertaining and amazing! I would recommend this to anyone. There was no line, just a few others there to see the lights as well.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the stress students have on them when it comes to finals, holding finals back until January just overall seems unfair. I think it’s cool that we as students are getting the chance to have a break from school, but it seems more logical to give us finals than send us on break. It doesn’t seem logical though to send us on break, then test us over everything we have learned over the semester. Most kids use their break to relax, so giving them tests when they get back from break may cause them to lose some knowledge making it to where the student body is overall more stressed out and mental health gets worse because of all the stress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting until January to take finals prolongs the semester’s stress that weighs on students. High school is meant to prepare students for the academic challenges they&#8217;ll face once they go on to college. For many teens, however, going the distance is a struggle. Students tend to get more stressed around finals because they have a mental barrier telling them they can’t do it. This commonly leads to them dropping out or letting their mental health get so bad and not reaching out for health and end up doing something like offing themselves which is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. The reasons that students end up dropping out vary–for some, it&#8217;s just a matter of poor attendance while others have to find work to support their family, it can also be common that stress is the reason why students end up dropping out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end of the semester is always a relief for students, and holding finals back delays that relief that students usually enjoy before the holidays. That refreshing moment when you have all your schoolwork done and it seems like you’re off the hook and you don’t have anything to worry about and that you’re ahead is the best feeling in the world. With a blink of an eye that feeling can go away and that stress you had before immediately comes back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking finals now, in December before the break would put a lot of stress on the students now, but giving finals after the break has the potential to send kids into overload. Some may feel unprepared because they’re been away from school for two weeks and information has been lost. Students may feel like there is nobody to reach out to because online schooling has left people feeling helpless for the main fact that we are all so distanced from each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school system is pushing so much information into our brains and it can truly be overwhelming. Reaching out to teachers tends to be difficult nowadays because they are bombarded with emails from stressed-out, overworked teenagers who just trying to get some help. Since students get so much school work their social time gets cut out and they lose some parts of themselves, this could have a serious impact on the mental health of not only the students but the people around them too. Every student may be in a different situation, some may be dealing with mental health; on the other hand, some may be dealing with family issues. The school system has been known from personal experiences and just as a generalized statement to push work down students’ throats making it to where they tend to be so overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;That saying, it’s unfair to students when they have to wait till January to take their finals because winter break is supposed to be there to relax but waiting to take finals may weigh on some leading them to not be able to relax. The school system is putting a lot of pressure on its students. It&#8217;s really unfair, young people shouldn&#8217;t have to be put through this much stress. I understand that it&#8217;s to &#8220;prepare us for adulthood&#8221; but a lot of stress is being placed on some that might not be ready for it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>In early November the United States became the first nation to see more than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases reported in a single day.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&nbsp; wide variety of people who don&#8217;t get symptoms make being out in public potentially dangerous for people With the holidays approaching, people have the urge to travel and visit family. The White House throughout the pandemic has continued to downplay the threat so people worry less, leading to numbers rising.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important Facts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers say the pandemic is responsible for roughly 1,000 fatalities per day, six times the average daily toll from the worst influenza season in the past decade</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s known that 20% to 40% of those infected are thought to be asymptomatic – they never exhibit any symptoms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel by bussing is something to avoid, they are considered high risk and are COVID transmission hot spots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking to travel, going by plane is the safest route. Planes have turbo-charged ventilation systems. Cars are also safer and an alternative when visiting people for Christmas and New Years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of personal protective equipment remains a chronic problem, especially in hot spots for the virus</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel is risky and unsafe right now but when looking for an option to get from place to place airplanes are the safest option for public transportation. Planes have a system installed to prevent recycled air from entering the cabin and potentially exposing others to the virus.&nbsp; Several airlines also instilled strict mask-wearing mandates and some require temperature checks and negative COVID test results before allowing passengers to board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the ending of November is when Kansas got hit the worst with a total of 7,497 confirmed cases. This was confirmed on November 23. As of December, the reports of positive tests have been in the 4,000s in the area. The reason for explaining the COVID-19 scores isn&#8217;t to scare people; it is simply to spread awareness of the current crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is key to note that America’s 60 million rural residents are older. Many of these older members of the community are diagnosed with chronic health problems at higher rates than the national average. It is important to understand that these older people are considered more at risk from the virus. Getting a COVID test to make sure you are negative before seeing people will end up being the best bet for keeping yourself and other people safe. False negatives are common though, and it&#8217;s no guarantee that you or anyone you know that might be traveling aren&#8217;t contagious. No matter what precautions you take a large number of gatherings have turned into spreader events because people who tested assumed it was safe to be in a large group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about other people and not just yourself is something that has the possibility to be life-saving. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you never watched any anime but want to know where to start? Well I have compiled a list of 10 animes in no particular order that I think beginners should start off their anime journey with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: This is a legendary anime. It has gorgeous art and animation, you get connected with characters straight away and the plot is captivating. Definitely a recommendation for someone wanting a good series to get sucked into.</span></p>

Just please go watch it, you won&#8217;t regret it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad moms Christmas&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Netflix&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 2017</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give: 4.5 star</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This movie was funny but also included scenes such as a mom and daughter reconnecting and making their relationship better. This movie shows a more realistic side to Christmas and doesn&#8217;t only show the happy parts like most movies do. I only took .5 off because this isn’t as much as a movie you would watch with little kids.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holidate</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">site: Netflix</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 2020</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give:4</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This movie was a cute romantic Christmas movie. It also was funny and had some drama in it. This is not as much of a movie to watch with little kids but it could be good for teenagers and a group of friends to watch together.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;How the Grinch stole Christmas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Netflix</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date:2000</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give:5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This is a classic Christmas movie that almost everyone knows and it is a movie I have watched many times and have not gotten sick of. This movie is funny while also having some drama and some thrill. It is good to watch any time around Christmas and can be watched with your whole family.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Christmas story</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Hulu</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date:1983</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give: 5 stars</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This is just a solid Christmas movie that many people know. It is an original one and is a funny one whereas many new Christmas movies are romantic ones or ones for kids. This movie is something fun to watch with your whole family.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grinch (new one)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Netflix</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date:2018</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give: 3.5 star</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: I feel like I would take a star and a half off only because it is a remake of the old one and i don’t find it as good as the old one. I personally like old original movies better but I do think that this movie is better for younger kids. I remember being younger and scared of this movie a little bit so I do think this one is more animated and joyful compared to the old one which is better for younger kids whereas the original Grinch movie is more fun for everyone.&nbsp; </span></li>
