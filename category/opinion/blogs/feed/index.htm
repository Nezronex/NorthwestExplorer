										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addams Family</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site:DVD</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 1991</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: 5/5&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: The Addams family is a classic movie that I enjoy watching at any point in the year but especially enjoy around Halloween. This movie is definitely an easy to follow movie but gives off creepy vibes. If you enjoy watching this then I highly recommend watching the Addams Family values.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hocus Pocus</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: DisneyPlus&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 1993</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: 4/5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This is a classic movie to watch during the spooky season and is interesting as the plot is based on older times. It is kind of spooky but it is still appropriate for most ages.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Halloween Town</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: DisneyPlus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 1998</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating:&nbsp; 5/5&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: Halloween town is a classic halloween movie that can be watched by all ages. There are four halloween town movies and they all correlate with each other. The halloweentown series is a good series to binge watch on during a cool fall day.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coraline</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Amazon prime video</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 2009&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: 3/5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: Although Coraline is a good movie with the editing and detail put into every scene, it still scares me so much to this day at 17 years old. I do think Coraline has a very interesting plot and would be an amazing movie to watch if I was not as terrified but until I become less scared I will keep the rating at a 3.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nightmare before Christmas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: DisneyPlus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 1993</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: 4/5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: Tim Burton movies are always classic movies to watch during halloween. The only reason I would give this movie a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the fact that it kind of has to do with Christmas a little bit. But if you are wanting to watch a more halloween movie by Tim Burton I would highly recommend watching Frankenweenie.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candy cane lane</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: N Azure circle, Wichita, KS 67235</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information: This a cul-de-sac that all goes together to decorate their houses with tons of Christmas decorations. Each house has their own displays and they also have a radio station where you can listen to Christmas music while looking at the lights. If you want to go be prepared to wait in a long line of cars!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: I would give this a 3.5. I would give it this rating because not everyone in the cul-de-sac had their houses decorated and it kind of sucked waiting in a 30 minutes line just to see the lights for like 4 minutes. The radio station also did not work well; it was very static and choppy sounding. Other than that the decorations were amazing and so much amazing work went into this.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reindeer road</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: N Firefly St, Wichita, KS 67235&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information: Reindeer road is a street right next to candy cane lane. Each yard that participates in the holiday decorations has a large reindeer in their yard ranging from 9-15 feet tall. If you go to this street be prepared to wait in a long line!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: I would rate this a 4. I really liked how they had reindeers in their yard to go with the reindeer road theme. Like the candy cane lane it was kind of sad that there were multiple houses that did not decorate or had minimum decoration and it was also a very long wait just to drive by it very fast.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christmas at the Mckinneys’</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: 1452 N Coolidge, Wichita, KS 67203</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information: Christmas at the Mckinneys’ is a family who decorates their yard every year with 150,000 lights! They also share their decorations with their neighbors yard. All of the lights go with radio station 89.7 where the lights go to the music making an amazing light show! This is a free thing to see but donations are accepted. All of the donations go to the Kansas Humane Society and HumanKind.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: I would rate this a 5. There is literally nothing bad I can say about this light show. There was not a long line, the music was good and the lights were outstanding! This was an amazing place to go see lights and I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone!</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9th street lights</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location: 3821 W 9th St, Wichita, KS 67203</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information: 9th street lights have more than 35,000 lights paired up with radio station 101.7 to make an amazing light show of lights that go with the music. They play many classic songs that all of their lights go to!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating: I would give this light show a 4.5 rating. I would only take .5 off because I wish I was in a better spot to experience everything better. Overall it was an amazing experience and I would definitely go back again! It was a smaller house with a huge light show that was very entertaining and amazing! I would recommend this to anyone. There was no line, just a few others there to see the lights as well.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad moms Christmas&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Netflix&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 2017</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give: 4.5 star</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This movie was funny but also included scenes such as a mom and daughter reconnecting and making their relationship better. This movie shows a more realistic side to Christmas and doesn&#8217;t only show the happy parts like most movies do. I only took .5 off because this isn’t as much as a movie you would watch with little kids.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holidate</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">site: Netflix</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 2020</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give:4</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This movie was a cute romantic Christmas movie. It also was funny and had some drama in it. This is not as much of a movie to watch with little kids but it could be good for teenagers and a group of friends to watch together.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;How the Grinch stole Christmas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Netflix</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date:2000</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give:5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This is a classic Christmas movie that almost everyone knows and it is a movie I have watched many times and have not gotten sick of. This movie is funny while also having some drama and some thrill. It is good to watch any time around Christmas and can be watched with your whole family.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Christmas story</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Hulu</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date:1983</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give: 5 stars</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This is just a solid Christmas movie that many people know. It is an original one and is a funny one whereas many new Christmas movies are romantic ones or ones for kids. This movie is something fun to watch with your whole family.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grinch (new one)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Netflix</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date:2018</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give: 3.5 star</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: I feel like I would take a star and a half off only because it is a remake of the old one and i don’t find it as good as the old one. I personally like old original movies better but I do think that this movie is better for younger kids. I remember being younger and scared of this movie a little bit so I do think this one is more animated and joyful compared to the old one which is better for younger kids whereas the original Grinch movie is more fun for everyone.&nbsp; </span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When it comes to jewelry and charms, there can be a lot of sentimental value behind items as small as your fingernail. Everything has a story and everything happens in a specific way for some reason. While jewelry has always been a way to have something physical to show off on your body, it also has significant meaning and symbolism. The meaning of jewelry varies based on the piece, materials used, the country, and the memories behind it. The value of jewelry changes with time and style.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Every piece of jewelry that has ever belonged to someone has a story behind it and has seen some part of history. It’s important to note that the value behind an item could be different for everyone some use it as a lucky charm, others use it as a way to remember that there is happiness still in this shattered world we live in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“The pin has served as a reminder of how happy I was and all the good friends I made back then,” Jay Rangel, junior.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Rangel said he believes that items hold a place in everyone’s heart, and that they all have different meanings behind them. In the early ages of Rangel’s life, he had a childhood friend and once they got separated she gave him a cat pin. The cat pin had shiny blue eyes and the rest of the cat was gold. The cat holds a small bell and has a ribbon, still gold, around its neck. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“The cat pin became like a lucky charm of sorts, and at this point, if it was ever lost I&#8217;d feel like I&#8217;d have lost a piece of who I was along with it,” Rangel said. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Freshman Pablo Lopez said that he wouldn’t be in the early college academy program if it has not been for his eighth-grade teacher who had a wide impact on him. Before Lopez left middle school, that teacher gave him a goldplated pin that says, drill team. Lopez said that before this teacher stepped up and became a positive role model for him, he never found anything interesting and always stayed inside.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Without that pin, my motivation would be completely gone, and I probably wouldn’t be here at all,” Lopez said. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> Lopez expresses that if he were to lose the pin, he would be really upset because it has been the one thing that means a lot to him.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“It’s been with me in the worst times of school and the best times of school. It was always in my backpack even on weekends and now it’s on my wall as a reminder that I am able to do more than what my body can,” Lopez said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple weeks ago I had the opportunity to go to the beautiful city of Chicago. The reasoning for my visit was to tour the wonderful school of “Columbia College of Chicago”, which is a Performing Arts College. After touring the school and falling even deeper in love with it I had the freedom to tour the Dazzling city of Chicago. I explored the city and got to expand my horizons by riding on the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) which is only one of the several ways to travel across the city. While traveling on the train, my first stop was at Randolph/Wabash which was at the heart of Chicago. There I toured Columbia and walked, and walked some more, and kept walking. And that was pretty much my first day.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day my dad and I rented a car and went down S. Lake Shore Drive, where you can find Lake Michigan, the Buckingham Fountain, Soldier Field, and the Shedd Aquarium. After we passed all of those significant places we went to my favorite place of the entire trip, N. State Street. I instantly fell in love with the area when I saw the beautiful bungalows and the beautiful fall trees, I found the  beauty of life in that very moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we continued our trip we saw the Trump building and Chicago in it&#8217;s natural state, from the graffiti to their very tall buildings. Chicago is truly a beautiful city and I highly recommend it for vacation if you love the busy city life and lively culture. </span></p>
