										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;" data-rich-links="{&quot;dat_df&quot;:{&quot;fres_frt&quot;:1,&quot;dfie_ts&quot;:{&quot;tv&quot;:{&quot;tv_s&quot;:1694433600,&quot;tv_n&quot;:0}},&quot;dfie_l&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;dfie_p&quot;:{&quot;fres_frt&quot;:0,&quot;tres_tv&quot;:&quot;MMM d, y&quot;},&quot;dfie_dt&quot;:&quot;Sep 11, 2023&quot;,&quot;dfie_pt&quot;:3,&quot;dfie_tpt&quot;:0,&quot;dfie_tzi&quot;:&quot;&quot;},&quot;type&quot;:&quot;date&quot;}">Sep 11, 2023</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Northwest sent their Press team, Video team, and three photographers to compete at the Kansas State Fair. Although it was raining all day non-stop, they put in the work and got it done. The Press team had eight hours to make and finish a four page newspaper based on the categories they received all dealing with things that were going on around the fair. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had a really exciting time at the state fair! It was a really educating experience because I learned how important it was to use your time well and create a story that draws attention. My favorite part was probably getting to just walk around and see other people having a good time hanging out with each other despite the rain. All the moods were high,” Aubrynn Lindrey (12) said .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Video team had three topics: Small business, First Aid, and Agriculture, which they then had to create thirty second clips of each representing the topic. One of the five on the video team Ayah Gharbi(12) says her favorite part of the trip was “Getting in the State Fair for free.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the three photographers Rylan Biggs, Kit O’Grady, and Samya Slater all competed in a photography internship in which they had to turn in four photographs within the categories of Food, Action, Agriculture, and Non-Agriculture. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was really interesting being able to take pictures at the fair and not just the school,” Kit O’Grady (12) said. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it won&#8217;t be announced for a while if anyone has placed yet one photo from photographer Slater and another from O&#8217;Grady did make it to the top #20 and are awaiting the finishing votes for best overall picture. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am very excited and proud of myself that one of my pictures made it to the top 20 and has a chance of winning the best overall picture,” Slater said.&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright and early Monday morning, August 14, 2023, Northwest High school welcomed our freshmen. There were 367 freshmen students who were navigating the halls, learning about the school’s culture and schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first week of school is different for everyone- freshmen are transitioning and rushing around trying to figure out the hallway system and how to be a high school student. Freshman Casey Stuart said the beginning of the year was an adjustment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was cool, kind of a bit boring. Awkward, though, because no one wanted to talk in class,” Stuart said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ike Childs said Northwest was better than his previous school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was pretty good, a lot calmer. Not as many fights surprisingly,” Childs said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One big difference, the freshmen have noticed, between high school and middle school is block scheduling and time difference. Here at Northwest, class periods are 80 minutes long, which some students were finding hard to get used to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“..classes aren’t too hard. Just longer periods and that’s annoying,” Childs said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change from middle school is lunch organization, everyone going at the same time. A benefit that seemed popular is being able to hang out with different grades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like being able to hang out with upperclassmen since there’s not many cool freshmen,” Childs said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tragedy strikes! One of the biggest parts of the school is now closed for reconstruction. A little back story on the reason the pool is closed, the far wall from the entrance of the Physical Education hall was rotting away near the windows, to the point where it became unsafe for people to be in that room until it&#8217;s repaired.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the students are very disappointed by the closing of the pool taking several of the fun things about the physical side of the school away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s like my freshman year all over again, not being able to use the pool for swim team or aquatics class,” Gabriel Bickham (12) said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assistant Swim Team Coach Tiffany Houle said the lack of a home pool might make things harder to recruit athletes for the team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “With the pool closed a difficulty I could see is the younger swimmers having a hard time traveling to West to have practice leading to the possibility of several swimmers not coming out for the team,” Houle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As follows, several students say they won&#8217;t have time or energy to travel to a different school for practice every single day.</span></p>
<p>The sudden closing of the pool create other issues too.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It definitely took everyone by surprise and the school made a quick turn around to combat the closing of the pool, getting rid of aquatics class and changing the curriculum for several classes involving the use of the pool. It&#8217;s a very unfortunate situation and it causes a hard shift for classes and sports teams of the Northwest, &#8221; Principal Eric Hofer-Holdeman said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;At this moment, no one knows when it will be back up and running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”We were told that the pool wouldn&#8217;t be open for the rest of the year, but we hope that by next school year it will be back in operation,&#8221; Houle said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There have already been many people for the school district coming and looking at the pool, deciding on whether to tear the whole section of that building down or just that room. For now, all that can be said is it is unsafe for anyone to be in that room unsupervised.&nbsp;</span></p>
