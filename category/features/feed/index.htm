Although it was raining all day non-stop, they put in the work and got it done. The Press team had eight hours to make and finish a four page newspaper based on the categories they received all dealing with things that were going on around the fair. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had a really exciting time at the state fair! It was a really educating experience because I learned how important it was to use your time well and create a story that draws attention. My favorite part was probably getting to just walk around and see other people having a good time hanging out with each other despite the rain. All the moods were high,” Aubrynn Lindrey (12) said .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Video team had three topics: Small business, First Aid, and Agriculture, which they then had to create thirty second clips of each representing the topic. One of the five on the video team Ayah Gharbi(12) says her favorite part of the trip was “Getting in the State Fair for free.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the three photographers Rylan Biggs, Kit O’Grady, and Samya Slater all competed in a photography internship in which they had to turn in four photographs within the categories of Food, Action, Agriculture, and Non-Agriculture. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was really interesting being able to take pictures at the fair and not just the school,” Kit O’Grady (12) said. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it won&#8217;t be announced for a while if anyone has placed yet one photo from photographer Slater and another from O&#8217;Grady did make it to the top #20 and are awaiting the finishing votes for best overall picture. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am very excited and proud of myself that one of my pictures made it to the top 20 and has a chance of winning the best overall picture,” Slater said.&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Could you please state your name?</b></p>
<p>I’m Mr. Holderman. I’m the principal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is your personal opinion on the hoods and hats rule that we’re not allowed to wear them?</b></p>
<p>It doesn’t seem fair, but it’s all about safety. We have to be able to see who everyone is in our building. We want to make sure that Northwest is the safest school we can possibly have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that when the students wear it, it affects their learning experience?</b></p>
<p>If hats and hoods were allowed, I think the majority of students would be able to handle it and would still be able to learn. I don’t disagree with that, but that’s not why we don’t allow hats and hoodies. I want to emphasize that it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that all schools should have this no hats and hoods policy?</b></p>
<p>I find it difficult to tell other schools what they should do. Just like I wouldn’t like it if they would tell me what to do.<b></b></p>
<p>******</p>
<p><b>If you could please state your name and your occupation?</b></p>
<p>Mr. Hammond the Assistant Principal of Northwest High School<b>.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is your personal opinion on hoods and hats?</b></p>
<p>I believe they are not to be at school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that it’s unprofessional?</b></p>
<p>It is unprofessional. If you ever find me outside of here you’ll find me in a hat. I would never wear a hat to work because I do believe that it is not professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that all schools should have a no hats or hoods policy?</b></p>
<p>I think it would be better if it was that way to where there is standardized message throughout the district because we do have transitional students that move from school to school. So I do believe that all schools should adopt the same of not having hats. Not when you’re leaving or you know, a baseball practice or whatever, but just not during the school day.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p><b>Please say your name and what grade you’re in.</b></p>
<p>My name is Casey Helms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that Northwest should allow their students to wear hoods and hats?</b></p>
<p>I don’t mind hats. I can see why they don’t like hoods but hats are different. Like I don’t understand why they don’t allow hats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think it’s unfair that Northwest doesn’t allow hats and hoods but other schools do?</b></p>
<p>I mean yeah. It’s so unfair if they’re doing it and we’re not.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p><b>Please say your name and what you teach.</b></p>
<p>My name is Jason Cotter, and I teach Social Studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think it should be a universal rule, yes or no. Or should it be individual schools to decide for themselves?</b></p>
<p>I think policies should ideally be district-wide. Because there’s a district policy against cell phones now, and it makes it easier for teachers or admin to justify that, because it&#8217;s not just our school doing that. This is something that the board of education has decided, And we agree with it and we support it here at Northwest, but if it&#8217;s just school to school then it does create conflict because a lot of friends may have somebody at West or North or a different school and they could, use that as an argument against you , “like why are they allowed at such and such school but not allowed to do it here?&#8221; And so I think it should be a policy one way or another all across the board, But I support the policy. So all right, Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is your personal opinion on the no hats or hoods rule here at Northwest?</b></p>
<p>Well, I, I support it because I think that students for one use their hoods and hats to hide their ear buds, which makes it easier for them to tune out the world, but also that they tend to use it to hide themselves too. Also, there’s a certain amount of professionalism we want in our classrooms. I don’t wear a hood or hat. And I don’t listen to music when I teach or play on my cell phone when I teach. And we want a professional environment and if you went to a restaurant and you were being served by someone, I bet that server wouldn’t have a hoodie up, right? We just want a sense of professionalism in our classroom, okay?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the pilot of E-hall passes last spring, it’s now Northwest’s permanent passing system, with a few updates. Last year, Northwest had introduced the E-hall pass, students returning back from spring break were confused on how this new passing system worked, along with some of the teachers. The new updates to how the system would work this year left everyone questioning how realistic the standards are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After we piloted last spring, we noticed that it was actually helping. We were having way too many students in the hall at once and it gives teachers a way to see how many students are out there,” said Assistant Principal, Ms. Bartsch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the summer there have been some changes to E-hall pass. The most important changes have been the time being cut down, for instance how long you’re allowed to be in the hall. Last year&#8217;s time limit was 7 minutes before you had been flagged down by an administrator or teacher. The new standards say that you must be back to class within a 5 minute period. Another additional change being instead of four passes a day, there are now three given to each student. You also could lose another pass if you end up being tardy to a class. To figure out the reasoning behind the changes I decided to interview the new Assistant Principal, Ms. Bartsch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are too many students that have overused the time and they would be gone for like 20 minutes or 15 minutes, and we need you guys to be in class that&#8217;s why we cut down the time,” said Bartsch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also a negative side to the E-hall pass. When students are filling out a pass and they get to the selection of the restroom they want to go to, it tells them that it is full. Or they are denied a pass because there are too many people in the hall. Students feel like it is unfair that they are denied a pass, when they know that some people still abuse the time. I had interviewed Senior Hayden Munro on what he thinks about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has happened to me three times where I have desperately needed to go to the bathroom, and there have been too many people in the hallway. I have to wait for a pass because too many people are in the bathroom,” Munro said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also an issue where teachers have forgotten to end the passes so it goes past the 5 minute mark. This can look bad on the student because it goes overtime and makes it seem like they’re wandering around wasting time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can understand it from a teacher&#8217;s point of view, it’s hard to clock everyone in each time they come back into the classroom. But I also think that there should be a way to adjust when you clock in so you could clock out later, and adjust the time for it because that ruins your time that you&#8217;re allowed out for the rest of the day,” he said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a new year of school starts, new rules are often introduced. This year the student population has seen a huge shift in rules with two sticking out the most. Firstly ID’s are mandatory, and secondly all use of cell phones during class has been prohibited. Leading to a general level of turbulence in the classroom with students and teachers often butting heads over the new policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with this several students believe that the new restrictions on phones can negatively impact their education, as Channing Aiken a senior puts it, “Simply teachers used cell phones for educational uses, whether it be for games like Kahoot, or things like if a website is blocked.” This creates an interesting point that phones do have a level of educational use, one that can’t easily be replaced by the heavily restricted laptops that students receive at the beginning of the year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even some students can admit how distracting they can be and how bad it can throw off their work. As Johnny Huynh a junior puts it, “I think I used my cell phone in like all my classes… I couldn’t get any work done.” This shows that at least even a few students can recognize the harmful potential cell phones can have on education.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the new students, many of whom weren’t able to use cell phones previously in middle school, many of them aren’t super passionate. Casey Helms a freshmen states, “I was kinda excited to have phones, but at the end of the day it isn’t a big deal.” Overall this best represents how students have varying thoughts on the new rule, and the change it will have on the classroom environment both positive and negative.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this past summer on July 21st, movie theaters were packed with people going to see one of two very different movies. On one side of the room all you could see were booming pink outfits, on the other established and distinct suits. This event was known on social media as “Barbenheimer” which is the combination of the names of the two movies that were premiering that day, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This double premiere made a great deal of noise due to both movies having very recognizable directors and actors behind it. People were making plans on which one they would see first and also what outfits they would wear to match the vibe of each movie.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the crowds started to disperse and all the popcorn had been popped, people were quick to voice their opinions on how they felt over the movies, and Northwest students did not fall behind.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I went to see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">because honestly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn’t interest me like the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movie did, and personally I loved it. I felt like it was really good commentary on womanhood, but also the struggles that both men and women face in society,” Audrey Buser (11) said.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved to be one of the most successful movies of the year so far making $1.34 billion and while Buser has only seen </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there’s equally other students that have only seen </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did not see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went to go see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m kind of a historical guy, I really like movies about the past and I’m also a little bit of a WWII geek so I like anything from that time, but I thought the movie was a little too long and I noticed it didn’t get a lot of promotion. I didn’t know of it until I saw a trailer at the movie theater,” Gabriel Bakker (12) said.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some students didn’t just see one movie, but instead went to both showings and were able to witness all the trends that took place.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to see Oppenheimer because it looked like a visually good movie and I thought it would be really good at IMAX, but I also wanted to see Barbie because it felt like a fun movie to go to and a fun thing to be at the theater for,” Elijah Gegen (12) said.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gegen expressed his excitement and reason for wanting to see both movies and very quickly gave us his thoughts after seeing them, he also told us which one he liked better.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a hard decision, but I think I liked Oppenheimer better, Barbie had some really good messages and it was just a fun movie to see, but with Oppenheimer I think it was like a really historically accurate movie and I feel like you know someone for one thing, but there’s also so much other things that happened for that to happen,” Gegen added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y.E, Youth Entrepreneurs, is a class Northwest offers to Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. The class teaches students the basics of starting and running a business, this includes the learning of COGS, revenue streams, business plans, etc. There are currently two classes of Y.E at Northwest, one ran by Chris Lambert and the other ran by Gavin Darr. The class to say the least requires a lot of effort for the students, so last year after everything was said and done both teachers pooled together and formed a game to reward students for all of their hard work. They decided that a kickball match would be held between the two classes in order to give them a fun way to wind down. However this would have the unintentional effect of creating a sort of joking rivalry between Darr and Lambert after Darr’s team won the first year of kickball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year Lambert was determined to win and so when the game commenced he hyped up his class. Running them through rules, and just ensuring that&nbsp; above all else they were having fun. Since Lambert had lost the previous year, his team was up to kick first. They got off to a phenomenal start as the first kicker slammed the ball across the field. Allowing for the first kicker to make it straight to second base.&nbsp; The game continued with a back and forth pattern, one team would score 2 or 3 points the other team would score 1-2.&nbsp; By the middle of the match Darr&#8217;s team was 2 point behind Lambert&#8217;s, and the pressure was kept up. The next kicker, and first of his inning, Johnny Huynh hit a straight shot right through the defenses of Darr’s team. Allowing Lambert&#8217;s team to get a free home-run, driving the score up by one more. Momentum from there continued and it seemed like the match had been settled.&nbsp; In the end Lambert held their lead and won the 2nd Annual Y.E Kickball game with a final score of 9-7. Although Darr’s team lost, both teams enjoyed themselves with lots of laugh and overall positive energy in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d say overall it was pretty fun and very engaging, it was a good way to end off the year,” said Sam Hohman student Lambert&#8217;s class.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The orchestra had its last concert of the 2022-23 school year, Tuesday, May 16th, which was a perfect goodbye for the seniors. Compared to the school’s band, the orchestra is not as visible, given that they don’t perform during pep rallies or sporting events. During this concert they had three sections; the Sinfonietta Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, and Concert Orchestra.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sinfonietta section was titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruisin’ Around the World,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and they played Adventure on the High Seas, Lijiang River Landscape, Ye Bonnie Banks ‘n’ Braes, and Caribbean Cruise. The Chamber section was titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Takes Two Bears to Tango, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and they played La Bamba, Manhā de Carnaval, and Por Una Cabeza. Lastly, the Concert section was titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seniors on Broadway </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and they did a mashup of a few songs from these three musicals, Mamma Mia with solos from Ruth Arrasmith, Isabella Straight, and Elexis Williams, Beauty and the Beast with solos from Carolina Contreras, Renee Amaya, Lizbeth Diaz, and Ruth West, and then Hamilton with solos from Sophia Anderson, Kristina Guitierrez, Luis Piedra, and Brayden Hoang.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the last section of the concert the director, Madeline Crawford gave some awards, these included letters, certificates, and cords for the seniors, and then she awarded two students for showing great amounts of leadership. Isabella Straight got the National School Orchestra Award, voted by her fellow classmates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt shocked because even though I have been a concertmaster for five years I’m not always the nicest person,” said Straight (12).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The next one was Director’s Choice Award and it went to Elexis Williams, as the name suggests this was chosen by their director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was grateful and excited that my work during the year was being recognized,” said Williams (12).</span></p>
