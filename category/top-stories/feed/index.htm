Although it was raining all day non-stop, they put in the work and got it done. The Press team had eight hours to make and finish a four page newspaper based on the categories they received all dealing with things that were going on around the fair. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had a really exciting time at the state fair! It was a really educating experience because I learned how important it was to use your time well and create a story that draws attention. My favorite part was probably getting to just walk around and see other people having a good time hanging out with each other despite the rain. All the moods were high,” Aubrynn Lindrey (12) said .</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Video team had three topics: Small business, First Aid, and Agriculture, which they then had to create thirty second clips of each representing the topic. One of the five on the video team Ayah Gharbi(12) says her favorite part of the trip was “Getting in the State Fair for free.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the three photographers Rylan Biggs, Kit O’Grady, and Samya Slater all competed in a photography internship in which they had to turn in four photographs within the categories of Food, Action, Agriculture, and Non-Agriculture. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was really interesting being able to take pictures at the fair and not just the school,” Kit O’Grady (12) said. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it won&#8217;t be announced for a while if anyone has placed yet one photo from photographer Slater and another from O&#8217;Grady did make it to the top #20 and are awaiting the finishing votes for best overall picture. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am very excited and proud of myself that one of my pictures made it to the top 20 and has a chance of winning the best overall picture,” Slater said.&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In early September, a play called A Midsummer Night’s Dream was performed at Northwest High. Karlis Hackney, a sophomore at Northwest, was given the privilege of being stage director for this play. She reflects on her experience in theatre, the play, and shares her hopes for future productions and the theatre program as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>What made you realize you want to get involved in theater? </strong></p>
<p>“So when I was younger, my mom would always have theater going on. It would be like a musical theater movie, or she would listen to a theater soundtrack. As I grew up, I sort of realized that was something that was really interesting to me. When I did my first show last year, I realized it was so much fun. I loved having to work with so many people who did so many different things. It was very interesting, very intricate, and there was a really good turnout. So, yeah, I love the ending result of a full show after working for a couple months.”</p>
<p><strong>What is your role in theater?</strong></p>
<p>“It kind of depends. If I&#8217;m acting, then I get whatever acting role that they give me. And then I haven&#8217;t really done a lot of outside of acting. I&#8217;ve done stage manager a couple times. But I&#8217;m also really interested in costumes and lights and set, like building the set, and other stuff. It&#8217;s kind of like whatever you want to do, really, and they&#8217;ll find something for you to do.”</p>
<p><strong>What was it like working with the cast in the beginning of A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream?</strong></p>
<p>“It was really fun. We casted in May last year so they had to know their lines at the beginning of this school year. When we started, a lot of them were memorized. All we had to do was go over lines and then start blocking, which is like where they move on the stage and just the actions you do when you&#8217;re on stage. It was very fun because a lot of people knew what they were doing, and they knew what they needed to be doing. For the other half of them, a lot of them were new actors, and it was really fun to see them grow into the actors that they knew they could be, and I thought they could be because a lot of people were really scared to start off with. By the end of the show, they were very, very good and very confident in themselves.”</p>
<p><strong>You say that they grew, how would you compare their beginning performance to how they were at the end?</strong></p>
<p>“So something I noticed in a lot of people is that when they&#8217;re off stage and they&#8217;re being themselves, they&#8217;re very likable and very confident, right? So then when they get on stage, they just take that away, and they&#8217;re very monotone and they&#8217;re not as full and confident as they were when they&#8217;re off stage. And so, by the end of the show, you can see how they took</p>
<p>themselves and put it into their role and make it, like I said, full and confident. It&#8217;s like, I know I&#8217;ve done this a lot to where, like, I&#8217;m not as like ‘silly’ when I&#8217;m on stage, but it&#8217;s just a lot of growing and becoming more confident yourself.”</p>
<p><strong>What would you say was the best part about managing the play?</strong></p>
<p>“I think maybe the responsibility because being a stage manager isn&#8217;t really a role that sophomores get and so getting that responsibility was a really good feeling and good thing for me.”</p>
<p><strong>What would you say was most difficult about managing since you’re a sophomore?</strong></p>
<p>“So Mr. Wehry was gone a couple times and I had to manage by myself a cast of, like, 20 people, which is not that much but it&#8217;s still pretty big. And then, obviously, having to write down the blocking and everything for every single scene. It&#8217;s just a lot of organization and being stern. I&#8217;m not a very stern person, like I&#8217;m not going to get on you for little things, but you kind of have to do that when you’re stage manager.”</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any funny stories from rehearsals or anything else?</strong></p>
<p>“Not from rehearsals, but I know during one of the shows, when Donavan who played Demetrius, when he ran offstage, the choir bleachers are right there. And when he was running underneath the bridge and offstage, he almost hit his head on the bleachers. It was really scary, but it&#8217;s really funny at the same time, and you can laugh because it was a performance. So it was, it was crazy. Yeah.”</p>
<p><strong>Was that the first night?</strong></p>
<p>“Um, I think so. Because like after every night, we’d be really scared about what was going to happen.”</p>
<p><strong>What have you learned from your experience in managing that play?</strong></p>
<p>“So you kind of learn a lot of what happens behind the scenes because when you&#8217;re acting, you&#8217;re really only thinking about what you need to be doing. When you&#8217;re stage manager, you have to make sure that people on stage are doing their job, people backstage are doing their job, and people up in the booth are doing their job. It&#8217;s kind of overlooking everything. I learned a lot about how things happen, or how they work behind the scenes, which was a really fun experience I would want to do again because it was so much fun.”</p>
<p><strong>*Would you manage again for Into the Woods?</strong></p>
<p>“Not Into the Woods, they already have a stage manager for that. And I will never ever, ever do stage manager for a musical because it is a much bigger job than I can handle. But maybe for another play, and I&#8217;m in rep theatre, and they have the 1 acts every year, so maybe I&#8217;ll stage manager or direct a show for that.”</p>
<p><strong>What are your hopes for the next school play?</strong></p>
<p>“For Into the Woods, I want to get in. Our play this year is student directed by Hayden Munro, and honestly, I&#8217;d love to stage manage that but also, I’d love to be in that as well. But I think that we started off the school year really, really well. We had a really good project just starting the year. So I think as the school year goes on, it&#8217;ll just get better and better. We&#8217;ll have better and better turnouts, and we&#8217;ll have better productions. And then hopefully by my senior year, it&#8217;ll be a great program that is very organized and bigger than it is now. I don&#8217;t know, because my freshman year it was still good, but I think by my senior it could be really good. Like, way better.”</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything in particular you&#8217;re excited or curious about?</strong></p>
<p>“For Into the Woods, I&#8217;m really excited about the set and music because Stephen Sondheim is a musical genius. I’m really, really excited for Into the Woods because I think that even if I don&#8217;t get in, it&#8217;ll be so much fun to watch because has such a good set and music.”</p>
<p><strong>So you&#8217;re excited for the set and the music, does that mean you have background knowledge of the play?</strong></p>
<p>“Yes, so I&#8217;ve seen the movie a million times and I listened to the soundtrack. It’s not that big of background knowledge, but I think that this is a really, really big production. Especially for high school because the music and the set and the lights and the sounds, it&#8217;s really intricate and it&#8217;s really complicated. And so, for doing it for high school, we have really high hopes, right? I think we will reach [the audience], hopefully, but I know it&#8217;s going to be good because we have amazing singers here and we have amazing set builders and I&#8217;m really excited for how it turns out.”</p>
<p><strong>What is it like managing to be an ECA student and then also being really involved with theatre?</strong></p>
<p>“It&#8217;s kind of like you really have to plan out your things, because I&#8217;m also in an AP class, which is a lot of homework. It&#8217;s easy work, but it&#8217;s a lot. And so then having all that homework, plus all my other homework from other classes, and then making sure that I&#8217;m able to get up on time for ECA, and then making sure that I&#8217;m able to like stay after school for rehearsals, and then also on top of being here for a long time, making sure I can get all my homework done, and making sure that I do a good job on my homework. And also, I&#8217;m in orchestra so I have to practice my violin. And then there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that I still want to do, I still hope to do throughout the school year, but I think this is good for now. It&#8217;s a pretty good schedule, but a lot of it is just making sure that you communicate with people to make sure that you know what you&#8217;re doing and then the days that you can be there. Also communicating with my mom because my mom has to drive me everywhere. So, it&#8217;s a lot of communication and organization.”</p>
<p><strong>What would you say is the best part about theater as a whole?</strong></p>
<p>“I think the people because it&#8217;s a lot of people who feel the same way about theater as you do. And so, surrounding yourself with people that are good for you is this really good thing. And</p>
<p>also, people who share your same passion for anything related is just a really good thing. It&#8217;s fun, and literally there&#8217;s never been a time where I haven&#8217;t had fun at rehearsal. It&#8217;s so much fun and I think everyone should join just once.”</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you would like to add?</strong></p>
<p>“Um, don&#8217;t hate on theater kids, I’ll fight you.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After starting out as an English teacher in 2012 and also becoming the Avid coordinator in 2021, this Q &amp; A explores what feelings Mrs. Bartsch had after becoming an assistant principal this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;What was your biggest concern moving up and becoming an assistant principal?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was nervous that I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to get to know the students better than I would&#8217;ve in the classroom”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Do you like being assistant principal rather than a teacher so far?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like both positions a lot, but they are very different, I used to have a day-to-day schedule in set but now I have to make my own schedule”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;How have your responsibilities changed?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to handle more adults now, also there is more responsibility and more legal procedures I have to follow”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright and early Monday morning, August 14, 2023, Northwest High school welcomed our freshmen. There were 367 freshmen students who were navigating the halls, learning about the school’s culture and schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first week of school is different for everyone- freshmen are transitioning and rushing around trying to figure out the hallway system and how to be a high school student. Freshman Casey Stuart said the beginning of the year was an adjustment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was cool, kind of a bit boring. Awkward, though, because no one wanted to talk in class,” Stuart said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ike Childs said Northwest was better than his previous school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was pretty good, a lot calmer. Not as many fights surprisingly,” Childs said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One big difference, the freshmen have noticed, between high school and middle school is block scheduling and time difference. Here at Northwest, class periods are 80 minutes long, which some students were finding hard to get used to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“..classes aren’t too hard. Just longer periods and that’s annoying,” Childs said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change from middle school is lunch organization, everyone going at the same time. A benefit that seemed popular is being able to hang out with different grades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like being able to hang out with upperclassmen since there’s not many cool freshmen,” Childs said.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Could you please state your name?</b></p>
<p>I’m Mr. Holderman. I’m the principal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is your personal opinion on the hoods and hats rule that we’re not allowed to wear them?</b></p>
<p>It doesn’t seem fair, but it’s all about safety. We have to be able to see who everyone is in our building. We want to make sure that Northwest is the safest school we can possibly have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that when the students wear it, it affects their learning experience?</b></p>
<p>If hats and hoods were allowed, I think the majority of students would be able to handle it and would still be able to learn. I don’t disagree with that, but that’s not why we don’t allow hats and hoodies. I want to emphasize that it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that all schools should have this no hats and hoods policy?</b></p>
<p>I find it difficult to tell other schools what they should do. Just like I wouldn’t like it if they would tell me what to do.<b></b></p>
<p>******</p>
<p><b>If you could please state your name and your occupation?</b></p>
<p>Mr. Hammond the Assistant Principal of Northwest High School<b>.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is your personal opinion on hoods and hats?</b></p>
<p>I believe they are not to be at school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that it’s unprofessional?</b></p>
<p>It is unprofessional. If you ever find me outside of here you’ll find me in a hat. I would never wear a hat to work because I do believe that it is not professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that all schools should have a no hats or hoods policy?</b></p>
<p>I think it would be better if it was that way to where there is standardized message throughout the district because we do have transitional students that move from school to school. So I do believe that all schools should adopt the same of not having hats. Not when you’re leaving or you know, a baseball practice or whatever, but just not during the school day.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p><b>Please say your name and what grade you’re in.</b></p>
<p>My name is Casey Helms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think that Northwest should allow their students to wear hoods and hats?</b></p>
<p>I don’t mind hats. I can see why they don’t like hoods but hats are different. Like I don’t understand why they don’t allow hats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think it’s unfair that Northwest doesn’t allow hats and hoods but other schools do?</b></p>
<p>I mean yeah. It’s so unfair if they’re doing it and we’re not.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p><b>Please say your name and what you teach.</b></p>
<p>My name is Jason Cotter, and I teach Social Studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do you think it should be a universal rule, yes or no. Or should it be individual schools to decide for themselves?</b></p>
<p>I think policies should ideally be district-wide. Because there’s a district policy against cell phones now, and it makes it easier for teachers or admin to justify that, because it&#8217;s not just our school doing that. This is something that the board of education has decided, And we agree with it and we support it here at Northwest, but if it&#8217;s just school to school then it does create conflict because a lot of friends may have somebody at West or North or a different school and they could, use that as an argument against you , “like why are they allowed at such and such school but not allowed to do it here?&#8221; And so I think it should be a policy one way or another all across the board, But I support the policy. So all right, Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is your personal opinion on the no hats or hoods rule here at Northwest?</b></p>
<p>Well, I, I support it because I think that students for one use their hoods and hats to hide their ear buds, which makes it easier for them to tune out the world, but also that they tend to use it to hide themselves too. Also, there’s a certain amount of professionalism we want in our classrooms. I don’t wear a hood or hat. And I don’t listen to music when I teach or play on my cell phone when I teach. And we want a professional environment and if you went to a restaurant and you were being served by someone, I bet that server wouldn’t have a hoodie up, right? We just want a sense of professionalism in our classroom, okay?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;The SRG grading system is a grading scale that has been increasingly used in classes. It is a system used by our teachers to help kids on their behalf with their understanding of the subject or even unit.&nbsp; But here at Northwest High School the grading system is reverting back to how it normally was a few years ago.</span></p>
<p>Part of the reason for the change was general confusion.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;“A lot of kids didn’t understand the grading part of SRG which made our students not like it and made them even more uninterested in the grading system,”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> Principal Eric Hofer-Holdeman said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;According to assistant principal Hammond “We are still using the SRG planning system for assignments.”&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some teachers and students said it gives a better understanding of the assignment and for students to know the exact detail within the topic or unit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The power law was a big part in why some believed SRG was taken away from Northwest. The power laws weighted later assignments heavier than assignments from earlier in the semester.&nbsp; </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">USD 259 is preparing students to be successful in college and more, with having SRG for students a while back that did not use our SRG weren’t prepared for the grading system in college and other educational fields according to</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Assistant Principal Charlie Bartsch, </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“In college they don’t use SRG which would make USD 259 goals no where they are wanting them too. While now at Northwest we can prepare students for their next level of education and help them achieve their goals,”</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Bartsch said. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Students at Northwest were happy with this change, CJ Mertes (12) was one of the students that were happy with this change. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“I was happy with this change because it felt like it would bring my grade down and cause me to have stress about what my grades were,” Mertes said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tragedy strikes! One of the biggest parts of the school is now closed for reconstruction. A little back story on the reason the pool is closed, the far wall from the entrance of the Physical Education hall was rotting away near the windows, to the point where it became unsafe for people to be in that room until it&#8217;s repaired.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of the students are very disappointed by the closing of the pool taking several of the fun things about the physical side of the school away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s like my freshman year all over again, not being able to use the pool for swim team or aquatics class,” Gabriel Bickham (12) said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assistant Swim Team Coach Tiffany Houle said the lack of a home pool might make things harder to recruit athletes for the team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “With the pool closed a difficulty I could see is the younger swimmers having a hard time traveling to West to have practice leading to the possibility of several swimmers not coming out for the team,” Houle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As follows, several students say they won&#8217;t have time or energy to travel to a different school for practice every single day.</span></p>
<p>The sudden closing of the pool create other issues too.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It definitely took everyone by surprise and the school made a quick turn around to combat the closing of the pool, getting rid of aquatics class and changing the curriculum for several classes involving the use of the pool. It&#8217;s a very unfortunate situation and it causes a hard shift for classes and sports teams of the Northwest, &#8221; Principal Eric Hofer-Holdeman said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;At this moment, no one knows when it will be back up and running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”We were told that the pool wouldn&#8217;t be open for the rest of the year, but we hope that by next school year it will be back in operation,&#8221; Houle said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There have already been many people for the school district coming and looking at the pool, deciding on whether to tear the whole section of that building down or just that room. For now, all that can be said is it is unsafe for anyone to be in that room unsupervised.&nbsp;</span></p>
