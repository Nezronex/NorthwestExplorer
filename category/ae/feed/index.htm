<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest high school’s extracurricular activities, sports, and clubs have been seen a little differently as other schools in the district due to the recent coronavirus pandemic. Northwest high school has recently been continuing with certain clubs and sports, one of those including Scholars Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Scholar’s bowl team has been practicing remotely, although originally, they were practicing in school face to face social distancing, wearing masks, and sanitizing their hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[T]he season started very late for us, as schools whose tournaments we typically attend were postponing competitions to learn how to conduct online tournaments,” team coach Shawn Wingfield said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of all competing remotely at home, the scholars bowl team collectively decided it was best to meet at school and compete online as a team. They most recently competed in a virtual Scholars Bowl tournament hosted by Garden City on December 8th. They competed in a pool with five schools. With the top two schools advancing to quarter-finals. Northwest was in a three-way tie with a&nbsp; 3-1 record after preliminary rounds and missed advancing on the second tiebreaker.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this not being a normal school year parents were not allowed to come watch their child compete for safety reasons.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That being said, City League, Regionals and State will all be in-person competitions.&nbsp; We would love for parents to join us,” Winfield said. &nbsp; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The time has come again when all of the major gaming franchises release their newest games and compete for the profits. Although I started off with the Zelda series, I have grown to love the first-person shooter, Halo.<br />
When I got home from the midnight release, I made probably one of the best decisions. I opened the game, downloaded the extras hidden within, and started to play. After a little frustration with Xbox Live, I decided to watch the Forward Unto Dawn live action film. Even though it was a 90 minute Halo film, it was really well made, setting up the background between Commander Lasky and Master Chief without leaving any huge gaps in the storyline.<br />
I then moved onto the campaign, which had amazing graphics and kept Chief’s story going. The end of the campaign is one that really reminds players of the fact that Bungie no longer makes Halo, and lets us know of their hopes to make more.<br />
The multiplayer is a great addition, having things like Team Slayer and SWAT for veterans and games like Regicide and Spartan Ops to help usher in the new era of Halo. Although they did get rid of Firefight-which I hope they will bring back on a later date-I’m not too upset.<br />
They also succeeded at fusing the best of two games. Along with being able to change your character armor, you can also create your own loadouts that can be used online, just like Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Another thing that many people have taken advantage of in the past, Forge Mode, is back and better than ever. They have kept most of the things from Reach and have added new features, some being map specific pieces and magnets, which really speed up the map making process.</p>
<p>After playing 4 in its entirety, I can’t wait to see what they do next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last of the franchise. It&#8217;s finally over. Breaking Dawn Part Two, after seeing all the movies and reading all the books I think that Breaking dawn Part Two was a great way to end the series.<br />
It had a lot  of action and also a happy ending, although my only two problems with the movie was the CGI, it felt like I was watching graphics from 2001, I mean I know that Twilight makes tons of money why not have spent it on some better CGI?<br />
The other was the bad acting it was very over dramatic but only towards the beginning after they brought it more characters it got better, other than that it was a good movie.<br />
Now if you&#8217;re not a fan of Twilight I wouldn&#8217;t recommend seeing it. But if you are, you will love it.<br />
Another nice touch at the end of the movie had credits from everyone in all of the movies from the Twilight saga.<br />
I would rate the movie a 3 out of 5.  But I would honestly would wait to see it on DVD instead of in the movies because it was a good movie but not worth seeing in the theater.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Imagine a world without electricity, no power whatsoever. A world where even the simplest of electronics don’t even make a spark. NBC has done just that in their new show Revolution.<br />
The basic plot of the story is about a world where the power has stopped for no apparent reason. The story picks up 15 years after the power went away and everyone lives in small villages or amongst the barren wastelands of former major cities.<br />
In this futuristic society the government has been abolished. It is now run by a group called the Monroe Republic under the dictator General Bass Monroe (David Lyons). This group is basically a giant militia that runs everything. They put a ban on any form of gun for public use, force people to pay crop taxes and are in desperate search to find someone to turn the power back on. In their minds, whoever controls the power controls the world.<br />
One man is said to know something about the power, Ben Matheson (Tim Guinee). The militia, led by Captain Tom Neville (Giancalo Esposito), goes after Ben in the hopes of restoring power for the Republic. Being the dramatic show that it is, of course Ben ends up dead and his son, Danny (Graham Rogers) gets kidnapped.<br />
This is where the real adventure starts. Ben’s daughter, Charlie (Tracy Spiridakos), and some others from the village go looking for Danny, and the only way to find him is through Ben’s brother, Miles (Billy Burke).<br />
With only three episodes out there isn’t much to tell without spoiling the whole show. The show is a great take on the perspective of taking a technology driven society and throwing them back to medieval times where it was a challenge to survive. It is an interesting concept for me to think about, being the tech guy that I am. But there are a few things that I find not quite right about this show.<br />
In many of the fighting scenes, the militia uses swords and flintlock guns to fight against the rebels. Yes. Swords like one would see on a pirate ship and guns that were used in the civil war. Now I know it has been 15 years after the blackout but still. Where would one even find such a vast collection of antique swords and guns to arm a whole militia? That is the major problem that I have seen with the series so far.<br />
Overall I think that everyone should at least watch one of the episodes, Monday nights at 10/9c on NBC, just to see what this world could possibly look like without power. It is a little bit scary to think about if the devices that I use everyday, like my phone and computer, just stopped working and how lost I would be. After seeing what our society could look like, I have come to realize that with every text message we send, every time we tweet, that our world is digging deeper into a situation like this. NBC, I salute you for opening up the eyes of this tech guy and helping me learn to power off every once in a while.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished watching the 9:10 showing of Paranormal Activity 2 at the 21st street Warren, and&#8230;..*shivers*. I&#8217;ll start off with the plot. Don&#8217;t worry though, there will be no spoilers in this article. You soon discover at the beginning, that this movie is actually a prequel to the original Paranormal Activity. It confused me at first when Katie, (the girl from PA1) just happens to be chillin’ out over at this new family&#8217;s house, but it is later stated that this footage is from about 60 days before Mika&#8217;s death and Katie&#8217;s disappearence. The movie starts off with a family bringing home their new-born baby Hunter from the hospital. The family consists of a father named Dan and his daughter from a previous marriage, his second wife Kristi, their hispanic house maid, their German Shepherd Abby, and of course little baby Hunter. Another thing to know is that Kristi is soon revealed to be Katie&#8217;s sister.</p>
<p>A few days after Hunter is brought home from the hospital, the family comes home to what they think is the aftermath of a burglary. The house is trashed as if they had just had a party, but the only thing missing is a necklace that Kristi&#8217;s sister had given her. In order to prevent further break-ins, the family installs six cameras throughout the house. One outside the front door, one over the pool out back, one overlooking the main entrance of the house (including the stairs to the second floor), one in the kitchen, living room (also showing the door to the basement),  and one in Hunter&#8217;s room. Through the lense of these security cameras, including a handheld video camera, we witness the second chapter of Paranormal Activity.</p>
<p>Now, for anyone who disliked the first movie, there is little chance that the second will change your mind. The scares are very similar to the first film, and the reactions to them as well. Because you never know when something is going to happen, you have to stay alert, and it&#8217;s difficult to keep your eyes from scanning the entire screen almost every second of the film. You&#8217;re nerves begin to stand on end every time darkness falls. As soon as it switches to the security camera footage and the words such as &#8220;Night 13: August 9, 2006&#8221; fade onto the screen, you know something bad is going to happen. As the first one did, the second film starts off a bit slow, but makes up for its lack of scares with new plot information and even some comedy. Because not only did this movie make the theatre scream, it made them laugh.</p>
<p>Personally, I loved the first Paranormal Activity. It scared me to death and made it hard to sleep that night, so I had high expectations for the sequel. The way they tie the first and second movie together is quite clever, and the effects are pretty cool, but the truth is that most of the movie is based on anticipation and by that I mean you spend more time waiting for something to happen then seeing things actually happen. The movie was about 75% anticipation, 15% substance, and 10% actual scares. The addition of a family pet and a toddler definitely qualify as a low blow in the film, just because you&#8217;d have to absolutely heartless not to fear for their safety. Also, this movie did nothing to help me get over my fear of dark basements. There were a few jump moments that in my opinion, you could not avoid unless you were paralyzed from the neck down, and when they decided to go &#8220;all out&#8221; with the scares, my heart was pumping a mile a minute and in the back of my mind I was saying &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this is happening right now!&#8221;</p>
<p>The security camera filming style made everything that much more realistic and I had to stop myself a few times from becoming too absorbed in the film by glancing over at the Warren Theatres clock on the wall or examining the chair in front of me. I have found that when I fully absorb myself in a movie it&#8217;s much easier to feel the raw terror that the characters are experiencing and when it comes to Paranormal activity 2, I&#8217;d rather avoid that. In the end, it all depends on what you find scary. Slasher films, with a kitchen knife and gallons of blood. Creatures films, with long fangs and a primal madness. Or Paranormal Activity 2, with falling pots and&#8230;&#8230;well, you&#8217;ll see. It gets to you because it&#8217;s more realistic. We can relate to hearing unexplained noises at night better than being chased by a werewolf, or a man in a jumpsuit and a hockey mask. Paranormal Avtivity 2 gives one explanation for those strange noises you hear at night and suceeds at triggering that &#8220;What if?&#8221; feeling long after you leave the theatre.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holly Berenson, played by Katherine Heigl, is a single, orderly, and slightly uptight bakery owner who gets sent on a blind date with a complete nincompoop named Eric Messer, played by Josh Duhamel. After he arrives an hour late, forgets to make a restaurant reservation, and answers a booty call right in front of her, she gives up on the date.</p>
<p>She calls her best friend Alison Novak, played by Christina Hendricks, and says the only way she could make it up to her was that she would never have to see him again. But sadly she has to see a lot more of him when their mutual best friends get married.</p>
<p>Holly has a successful bakery with dreams to expand and has met a guy named Sam who comes in everyday to buy the same exact sandwich. Messer’s job is directing cameras for a basketball team and spends his free time hooking up with as many girls as possible.</p>
<p>One night Holly and Messer get called down to the police station and learn that their best friends, Allison and Peter Novak, were killed in a car crash when their vehicle flipped. Holly and Messer spend the night at the Novak home and the next morning they pick up their 1-year-old daughter Sophie from child services. Sophie was played by Alexis, Brynn, and Brooke Clagett. When the Novak’s lawyer goes over the will with Holly and Messer they are shocked to find that they have both been named as the guardians of Sophie.</p>
<p>In an attempt to make it work, they move into the Novak’s home and raise Sophie. Things go along fine with only a few arguments until one night when they get stoned and decide to “complicate” their relationship.</p>
<p>Before they know it Holly is expanding her restaurant and Messer gets a job opportunity from the phoenix Suns. After a huge fight with Messer, he decides to take the job and leaves. Holly tries to move on and starts dating Sam, played by Josh Lucas. But sometimes it’s hard to let go of the past.</p>
<p><em> Life as we know it </em>is definitely a romantic comedy. It is the best love story I have seen since Letters to Juliet and will have you laughing throughout the movie. Holly and Messer’s complicated relationship and dysfunctional family is touching and easy to relate to.</p>
<p>The movie makes you feel like you really know the characters. Although Holly is meticulous and Messer is a jerk, audiences will end up loving them in the end. Although it came in second in box office sales for their opening weekend, <em>Life as We Know It</em> is definitely a movie to check out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a professional bank robber must be depressing. If I went through all that hard work to go in, grab the money and leave without a trace only to be looked down upon by society and possibly punished, my outlook on life would be pretty bleak. This is essentially the point of “The Town”, Ben Affleck’s second shot at directing, after 2007’s “Gone Baby Gone”. With a strong setting and cast of characters, “The Town” goes above and beyond to become one of the better heist movies of the last few years.</p>
<p>For Doug MacRay (Affleck) and his childhood best friend Jem Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), the art of the heist is a way of life in their native Charlestown, a neighborhood in Boston. MacRay enters into a relationship with a young woman named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) who they take hostage early in the film, who has no idea that the man she loves leads a life of crime. This of course causes great tension among MacRay and his crew, and makes him consider leaving this line of work. While the story may not be entirely original, it stays interesting over its two-hour runtime.</p>
<p>What really makes “The Town” shines is its characters and the actors who play them. Affleck’s performance as the troubled, but still morally decent MacRay goes a long way toward showing us that bank robbery does not lead to happiness and luxury. The same goes to Renner as Coughlin, who represents the negative effects a life of crime can have on someone. He’s so out of control that he becomes genuinely scary at points. The rest of the supporting cast keep the movie going as well, with special interest going toward Jon Hamm as the FBI agent who is on their tail throughout the whole movie. He comes across as being almost as crazy as Coughlin at times.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about “The Town” is the way in which it showcases Ben Affleck’s ability to direct. The film moves at a perfect pace, with no scene going on for too long or becoming boring. What audiences should look forward to the most, however, are the action sequences. Affleck handles the various heists and chases with incredible talent, never resorting to jerky camera work or computer-generated effects like so many filmmakers do these days. Special mention goes to a car chase throughout the narrow streets of Charlestown. It must have been nearly impossible to pull off, but Affleck does so perfectly.</p>
<p>It’s been a decent year for heist films. The second half of Christopher Nolan’s masterful “Inception” was essentially a long bank robbery, and “The Town” closes out the summer movie season in a good way with its morally complex characters and gripping direction. It’s safe to say that Ben Affleck has finally found his place in Hollywood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Vampire spoof of the Twilight Saga had twi-hards and twi-haters buzzing all over the internet. With attractive cast members and almost identical scenes, this movie cashed in on the Twilight pandemonium, making $20 million on its opening weekend.</p>
<p>Directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are known for releasing not-so original movies, but they knocked it out of the park with this flick. Whether you like Twilight or not, this movie is hilarious. It is the first spoof I’ve seen that actually held my interest, probably because of my insane love for everything Twilight.</p>
<p>Becca Crane, played by Jenn Proske, was a normal teenage girl who moves to Sporks, Washington and ends up falling in love with a make-up wearing, hair curling, stylish dressing, sparkling Vampire named Edward Sullen, played by Matt Lanter.</p>
<p>The Chihuahua transforming, cat chasing, Jacob White is played by Chris Riggi, who is shirtless the majority of the movie. But with a body like his, I’m not complaining. This movie takes scenes from the first two books in the saga and made fun of them in every possible way they could.</p>
<p>The movie jumps around a bit and the plot doesn’t flow as well as it could. A lot of time is spent poking fun at teenage emotions and experiences like hard break ups and drinking at prom.</p>
<p>All the actors and actresses played teenagers, even though I doubt they are under 20.With some violence and slight sexual references, this movie had comedy for a more mature audience. ­­­</p>
<p>From a dancing pack of werewolves in short shorts to Edward stripping down at prom to nothing but a big shiny disco ball, this movie had the whole theatre laughing. This generation’s obsession with vampires has lead to a new era in literature and movies. So with everything promoting the new view of vampires, there needs to be one good movie making fun of it. If you haven’t seen this movie yet then you better check it out while it’s still on the big screen.</p>
