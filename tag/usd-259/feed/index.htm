										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>In early November the United States became the first nation to see more than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases reported in a single day.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&nbsp; wide variety of people who don&#8217;t get symptoms make being out in public potentially dangerous for people With the holidays approaching, people have the urge to travel and visit family. The White House throughout the pandemic has continued to downplay the threat so people worry less, leading to numbers rising.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important Facts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers say the pandemic is responsible for roughly 1,000 fatalities per day, six times the average daily toll from the worst influenza season in the past decade</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s known that 20% to 40% of those infected are thought to be asymptomatic – they never exhibit any symptoms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel by bussing is something to avoid, they are considered high risk and are COVID transmission hot spots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking to travel, going by plane is the safest route. Planes have turbo-charged ventilation systems. Cars are also safer and an alternative when visiting people for Christmas and New Years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of personal protective equipment remains a chronic problem, especially in hot spots for the virus</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel is risky and unsafe right now but when looking for an option to get from place to place airplanes are the safest option for public transportation. Planes have a system installed to prevent recycled air from entering the cabin and potentially exposing others to the virus.&nbsp; Several airlines also instilled strict mask-wearing mandates and some require temperature checks and negative COVID test results before allowing passengers to board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the ending of November is when Kansas got hit the worst with a total of 7,497 confirmed cases. This was confirmed on November 23. As of December, the reports of positive tests have been in the 4,000s in the area. The reason for explaining the COVID-19 scores isn&#8217;t to scare people; it is simply to spread awareness of the current crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is key to note that America’s 60 million rural residents are older. Many of these older members of the community are diagnosed with chronic health problems at higher rates than the national average. It is important to understand that these older people are considered more at risk from the virus. Getting a COVID test to make sure you are negative before seeing people will end up being the best bet for keeping yourself and other people safe. False negatives are common though, and it&#8217;s no guarantee that you or anyone you know that might be traveling aren&#8217;t contagious. No matter what precautions you take a large number of gatherings have turned into spreader events because people who tested assumed it was safe to be in a large group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about other people and not just yourself is something that has the possibility to be life-saving. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FCCLA has a national membership of over 175,000 young men and women. There are 53 state associations including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, etc. FCCLA was founded in 1945, FCCLA has involved over nine million youth. This year Sara Abrahams had made an official group for Northwest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FCCLA group participates in community service activities, last week they did an operation holiday and last year They did competitions for things. Some of their activities include personal finances, consumer rights, and responsibilities, technology, health, and safety,&nbsp; environment, and FCCLA knowledge. With COVID, all of the competitions are online this year so they are not participating in them. Anyone at Northwest has the ability to join this after school group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s shown to be more beneficial to have joined if you have FAC classes (family and consumer sciences)classes that you have taken but it’s not required. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community service is apart of the class for this program but no background checks happen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since COVID had a set-back for many students and activities the FCCLA group meets once a week after school on teams. Being in-person makes it to where there are more opportunities for students to be able to do the activities available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara Abraham is the leader of the after school program, and Jesse Hancock is the President of the program led at Northwest. Right now there are a total of eight students that are in the group. This group is also available for students of all grade levels to join.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group usually meets around 2:45 P.M. making it to where you are able to join during their advocacy hour. During the time they meet, the group discusses what they are able to do around the community. This consists of things like picking up trash, operation holiday, etc. Sara Abraham explained that since things are mostly online it has been more difficult to do activities, she also explained that most community service project that is done in larger groups have been put to a halt because of the social distancing matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fcclainc.org is the official website for the program that Sara Abraham and a couple of other students are participating in. Students who are in the after-school program have the ability to earn scholarships by the end of their senior year. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into the school year and finding out that you’re not able to go back in person can be frustrating to some, relieving to others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the original plan was for secondary students to return to school for the second nine weeks, the school board reversed that because of rising Covid-19 rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This information has felt like bad luck for some simply because, missing out on the high school experience could be disappointing for most. Especially because people talk about the high school experience being out there and life-changing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m just waiting for the day that they say we can go back to school because that will make me feel better,” Daysha Ogunbiyi, senior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogunbiyi expressed that she feels like online school is something that everyone needs to get used to. Ogunbiyi explained that as a senior this is not how she wanted to spend her last year in high school. Ogunbiyi said that she and her fellow classmates are just waiting on the day students are allowed to go back in person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also explained that because she’s a senior she’s missing out on last dances, no first day of senior year, making new friends, visiting colleges, talking to the guidance counselors, and just having the overall high school experience for one last time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing motivation is something that can happen when you have high expectations; staying on task when at home can be extremely stressful or disruptive depending on what environment someone is in. It’s common to be able to not learn very quickly or effectively on the laptops this year because it’s still semi all-new, Ogunbiyi said when explaining that she had an easier time losing motivation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something that isn’t so good about online learning for students’ mental health is definitely the new socialization rules or ways of socializing” freshman Kylie Olsen, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olsen said that she has heard from other students that remote schooling has a positive effect on students’ organization skills, but she has not had as much trouble with the organization as most people. Olsen said that if there was a chance where she could go back and it would be safe for everyone she would take the offer. Olsen said she believes that being in person when at school is better for her because she thinks that staying focused is less challenging. Online school may not be the most ideal citation for some but for others, it may seem to work better making it to where their motivation goes up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think online school is going well so far; It’s not ideal but we are making the best out of a bad situation.” Emmarie Nickel, Senior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickel explained in an online interview that she understands that safety is what is important, regardless of if it’s what people like or not. Nickel also said she understands the importance of getting the high school experience and getting to do activities, but in an instance where people have a chance of getting sick, it’s best to keep safe and not go out and have fun. She said missing the social aspect of the school is something that crosses her mind quite often, but regardless of this, she would continue to stay online because it’s safe and she can enjoy the comfort of her own bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olsen explained that although it is challenging to do some of the activities people might have been looking forward to this year. It is also in the best interest of the people to stay online for schooling because it lowers the likelihood of more people getting sick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Education is our passport to the future, it takes us to success and makes the people in this world life changers for some” Olsen, Freshmen.</span></p>
