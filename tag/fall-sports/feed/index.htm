										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Student athletes participating in fall sports for this year found themselves required to sign the Code of Player Conduct.</p>
<p>The Code of Player Conduct was created after last year’s accreditation process and was put in place to hold student athletes accountable for their grades. It states “If a student/athlete has any combination of 3 D’s and/or F’s there may be consequences. Consequences begin Tuesday of each week.”</p>
<p>There are mixed feelings about the requirements from students and some are more aware than others of the new rule that states that any combination of 3 D’s or F’s, will leave them ineligible to practice or play.</p>
<p>But it isn’t intended to be a punishment according to athletic director Lance Deckinger. He says it is a way to help students and their parents be more aware.</p>
<p>“It just helps out the coaches and makes it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades,” Deckinger said. “We’re holding the kids accountable and have had a couple comments even from parents like ‘I didn’t even know my kid had these grades,’ and it helps everyone keep an eye on what’s important.”</p>
<p>Deckinger says the first week is a warning week to let athletes know they need to improve their grades.</p>
<p>“If you’re on it a second week, we’ll see which direction your grades are going,” Deckinger said, “and if they’re going in the wrong direction you’re not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, then you can keep on playing.”</p>
<p>Some students have already felt the effects of the new requirements, but aren’t too upset. They just find themselves rushing to get things done so they can participate and support their team.</p>
<p>“The list affects the soccer team because if you don’t keep your grades up&#8230; the team’s going to be one player down and they won’t be complete,” sophomore Jesus Morales said.</p>
<p>“I had to miss one game. [Before] next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.”</p>
<p>Students are well aware of the requirements for their grades, but fail to realize that absences can also define whether you play or not.</p>
<p>According to the Code of Conduct, students must be in school to participate in a game or practice. If a student is excused for more than half of the day they are not allowed to participate in a practice and/or game.</p>
<p>“They send it [the list] out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that’s always been a problem of knowing whether they’re here or not,” cheer coach Tiffany Houle said. “If they’re not here that means no practice and no games.”</p>
<p><strong><strong></p>
<p></strong></strong></p>
<p>Absences, however, are also now defining whether you can participate or not.</p>
<p>“The D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.”</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“The list affects the soccer team because if you don’t keep your grades up you won’t play. The team’s going to be one player down and they won’t be complete,” said sophomore  Jesus Morales. “I was on the D &amp; F list and I had to miss one game. (Before) next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.”</p>
<p>“The D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.”</p>
<p>WE STARTED HAVING A D F LIST THIS YEAR. JUST MAKING SURE WE’VE HAD STUDENTS IN THE PAST THAT WEREN’T ALWAYS PASSING CLASSES</p>
<p>AND IT’S JUST IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU’RE PASSING YOUR  CLASSES. AND DOING WHAT YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HERE FOR YOUR EDUCATION BEFORE YOU’RE DOING EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY.</p>
<p>THE FIRST WEEK IS SORTA A WARNING WEEK, hey you got some grades down, get your grades up. IF YOU’RE ON IT A SECOND WEEK WE’LL SEE WHICH DIRECTION YOUR GRADES ARE GOING and if they’re going to wrong direction, hey go get your grades up, your’e not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, and then you can keep playing.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>You shouldn’t probably be participating in co-curricular activities If you’re having three or four ds or fs. So that’s what started the list, so coaches and students could keep up with it. Because in the past when they had 4 5 ds and fs, they really shouldn’t be on the field</p>
<p>Everyone just got on the same page and said it’s time to start improving it.</p>
<p>when we had our accreditation this past year, every five years they have the accreditation, one of the things that came up was students, people who have low grades participating in co-curricular activities, why are these students, if they’re having low grades, out there when they can’t take care of their grades.</p>
<p>It’s helped out the coaches and made it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades. Holding the kids accountable and we’ve had a couple comments even from parents like ‘I didn’t even my kid had these grades’ and it helps everyone keep an eye on what’s important.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Yes it is helpful because I don’t have to look it up myself, they send it out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that’s always been a problem of knowing whether they’re here or not. So I like that they send an attendance list every day so we know if they’re in school. So if they’re not here that means no practice, no games, which is nice because like I said, I used to have to look it up individually but now I don’t have to do that because every week I’m getting a list and I only have to find the girls that are getting Ds or Fs</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“ I’m not a big fan, but you gotta do what you gotta do. To me it’s just more paperwork that gets in the way of things. Is the concept good? Yes. Does it hold athletes to a higher standard? Yes. But we had less than one percent of athletes that have physicals turned in have issues with grades so I didn’t really think it was necessary.” said Cross Country coach Ron Russel</p>
