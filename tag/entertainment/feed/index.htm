<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What got you interested in anime?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “My sister started reading a lot of the comic books when we were younger and then eventually I started reading some of those. I had, technically, been watching anime since I was a really little kid; I didn’t know it was anything different. Through different friends and family, it was just kind of a thing we watched and then when I was in my tweens and teen years then I just discovered ‘oh my gosh this is a big thing!’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What got you interested in cosplaying?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: “I’ve been coming to anime fest in Wichita for seven years now. And I&#8217;ve actually been making costumes and sewing since I was 6 and 7. I’ve actually been making costumes way before I had my realization about anime, but when I found out that I can have both of them together I just started sewing costumes and eventually I started competing in competitions.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: Have you been to other conventions other than the one in Wichita?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “I’ve been to ton of cons in the US. Not lots of big ones but I&#8217;ve started to expand a bit more.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What inspired your costume?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “I actually made every single piece of this. I pattered all of these &nbsp;[pieces of] clothing by myself. I do not use any store bought patterns. I do all of the sizing from scratch and, this whole prop and everything, I built myself.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This actually has a manga and an anime, its actually quite old. It’s called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardcaptor Sakura</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it’s one of the original, magical girl series. It’s kind of around the same age as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;.Kind of like in the 90s.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What&#8217;s your favorite anime? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>A:&nbsp;“I don’t think I have a specific favorite show. As far as certain movies, genres, and series that I like, I like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio Ghibli </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movies. Those were one of the first things I watched when I was a kid and they were amazing&#8230;.they’re some of the best parts of my childhood. They’re such inspirational, sweet, adventurous movies. It’s always amazing.” </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her costume took her nine hours and three evenings to make. Most of her costumes take longer than that, but this specific costume (as shown in the photo) was one of her most simple ones. She has multiple versions of the same character, therefore reusing the same wig and prop. </span></li>

I just come, mainly, to see all my friends that I, honestly, have through cosplay and whatnot. I just come to hang out and everything. I haven&#8217;t been doing any cosplay here in the last couple of years just because I&#8217;ve been working on other stuff. I used to be pretty big into it.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warning: Bring a life jacket.</p>
<p><i>If I Stay</i>, a film starring Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley, is an unconventional love story about a cellist and a rock star whose love is put under strain by a life disaster. Mia (Chloe Grace) and her family were in a brutal car crash that left her in a comma and the rest of her family dead. The movie is based off the idea that your destiny is what you choose. She is able to hear and see everything that goes on around her unresponsive body, and is left to make the choice to move on or to stay alive.</p>
<p>The movie was based off of the novel by Gayle Forman, and stuck closely to the plot of the book. Since <i>If I Stay </i>is one of my favorite books, I rushed to see it in film. There’s something about seeing the emotion play out on screen that hits you harder than any printed words could. This movie shows the raw emotion of family, friends, and personal struggles that come from a major life change, such as death. The sorrow and passion hits you like a brick to the face. If you go see this movie and have anything short of a heart of ice, you will be in tears. If you are anything like me, you will need a life jacket to swim out of your tears.</p>
<p>This movie is a must see for the season. Whether you are in need of a good cry, or just want to torture your sappy significant other, this movie will give you your sentimental fix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Superheroes are here to save television.</p>
<p>Well, to be precise, TV networks want superheroes, and their massive pre-existing fanbase  to bring them viewers (and therefore money).Several TV channels are planning to bring the stories of several comic book heroes and villains to life.</p>
<p>Fox is bringing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d1zpt6k5OI">GOTHAM</a> to the table, a show that picks up right after Bruce Wayne’s parents are murdered. It is being marketed as a giant origin story for both heroes and villains told from the POV of detective Jim Gordon. The only Batman villain not expected to make an appearance is Ra’s Al Ghul, the leader of the League of Assassins, the theory behind the absence of the villain is thought to be because he is expected to appear in the CW’s ARROW.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKE36sL6jKc">ARROW</a> is a popular television show based off of DC comics’ Green Arrow franchise and is currently hyping up excitement by releasing clips of major villain Ra’s Al Ghul, car chases, and appearances of Ray Palmer; the man who will later become The Atom.  It’s spin-off, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj0l7iGKh8g">THE FLASH</a>, features bumbling forensic scientist Barry Allen who finds himself struck by lighting and in a coma for nine months, only to wake up as the fastest man alive. After the pilot was screened at the San Diego Comic-Con, critics agreed that THE FLASH was not only the most promising of all of the new shows,but was also the most lighthearted, unlike it’s grittier “mother” show, or its competition,  NBC’s CONSTANTINE.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPE2oBnzROY">CONSTANTINE</a> is aiming to bring horror lovers to NBC with a TV series centered around the darker, scarier, side of comics. Think paranormal activity with a detective/vigilante as the lead character with DC characters such as Doctor Fate and Zatanna teased to join the show later.</p>
<p>On MARVEL side of the television spectrum, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tkfi6QtZQw">Agents of SHIELD</a> (whose ratings improved after Captain America: Winter soldier) is being renewed for a second season with the underlying uneasiness of “no-one-can-be-trusted” chatter surrounding the show following the revealing of major characters in the show being connected to HYDRA.  While Marvel seems to be dragging its feet with its other upcoming TV series, AGENT CARTER,  other properties are being put into the “in development” stage.</p>
<p>Whether you like superheroes or not, the sheer amount of DC/Marvel shows on television is important. First, it shows what people want to watch, which means TV channels will order similar shows, leading to realistic TV shows having a much harder job selling their pitch. Second, comics shows off America in a way nothing else can. Every culture has stories that change and reflect the views of that particular group as time goes on. The Greeks had their myths, the British have King Arthur, but comic books? Comic books really started turning into something popular in America during the Great Depression, and the stories have grown with America, featured American heroes (Captain America) and reflected American values and beliefs. In the end, aren’t most comic book heros supposed to represent truth, justice, and the American way?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Yeezus, a.k.a Yeezy, a.k.a Kanye West is a 21st century Michelangelo. He’s a genius. A great thinker. An artist. He’s more than just a rapper. He’s more than just a major a-hole. People are missing the bigger picture.</p>
<p> Kanye West might &#8211; actually, does &#8211; come off as a major douche bag married to one of the most beautiful women in the world. People think he’s arrogant, selfish, and even evil. He has had many crazy incidents, to say the least, in the public media. From taking down paparazzi to speech interruptions at music awards, Mr. West has made himself a worldwide household name.</p>
<p>Kanye. Rapper. Musician. Producer. Director. Fashion designer. Just some of the things on his resume. If I had his schedule and a newly born baby with probably one of the most famous women in the world I’d also be a bona fide “jerk.”</p>
<p>What people don’t understand is that he has contributed so much to the world in many aspects. He’s made some of the best music in rap. He’s made leather pants that you see across fashion blogs across the world. He’s changed the way media is produced and directed. Just take the visuals for his single Black Skinhead as an example.</p>
<p>Even when he was told to change or just quit, he hasn’t given up. He has stayed true to himself. Like he said in one of his rants before, corporation can’t change him.</p>
<p>You see, if you’re a fan of Kanye West then you’re a fan of yourself, which he said in an interview with the BBC. If you like Kanye, then you want to be the best. Better yourself from the ordinary. West fans are usually leaders and people who aren’t afraid to say their thoughts. Go- getters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people who despise Kanye are probably conservatives with low self-esteem who are used to being told what to do. People that just follow and go with the flow. If you just simply don&#8217;t like his music then this doesn&#8217;t apply to you. Even then, everyone should like his music! His music is genius.</p>
<p>People who don’t like Yeezy are probably just jealous that he can do what he wants. Maybe they’re  just jealous that they’re not as happy for themselves as Kanye.</p>
<p>If it was up to me, I’d say we should have more Kanye Wests in this world. People who are leaders, who aren’t afraid to say what they think, and who stand out. That is why Yeezus is the man I look up to the most in this world. I could go on all day and give even more reasons why Kanye is the black Steve Jobs but I’m sure this article will cause enough controversy as it is.</p>
