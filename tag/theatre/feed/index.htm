										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Auditions for the North/Northwest collaboration of “Grease” were held in the Northwest auditorium on Aug. 21 and 22.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be a cool project,” North drama teacher Tyrone Galbreath said. “Lundin and I have been friends for a while so we thought we’d try this out and I think it’ll be kind of cool to bring two schools together and work on a project.”</p>
<p>Over 100 kids auditioned in the two day period.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>“Auditions are taking a little longer than I wanted but that’s really a good thing,” Northwest drama teacher Richard Lundin said. “That means that lots of kids are showing up.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Theatre Review- Payden Klufa</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Feb. 20, 21, and 22, the Wichita Northwest Drama program performed the play Fools written by Neil Simon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The play was about a young Russian teacher, Leon Tolchinsky, that scored a job in a small village. When he arrives he finds out that all the citizens of the village have been cursed with Chronic Stupidity for 200 years. Confused and frustrated, just as he was giving up on teaching the citizens, he falls hopelessly in love with a stupid girl, who recently just learned how to sit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tolchinsky was played by Junior Joshua Peavey, and the stupid girl was played by Senior Paige Lundin. The two actors did a wonderful job playing their parts, and end the play without a dull moment. Peavey and Lundin had great on stage chemistry, and the rest of the crew did a wonderful job making the play worth watching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The play followed a dinner, and included a short 15 minute intermission, including dessert you could buy before you watched the second half. Richard Lundin, the director, did an amazing job putting together a wonderful, funny show that left the audience craving more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The drama department never ceases to amaze me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Upon attending the second night of one acts on Saturday, Nov. 23, this is the thought that crossed my mind.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The student-directed (and sometimes student-written) one acts featured students, who were mostly freshmen and sophomores, who performed skits that lasted around 20 minutes each.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each performance was absolutely hysterical. “The Real Problem,” which was directed by junior Elizabeth Kramer, had me in tears.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Countless evenings spent in rehearsal, hours spent memorizing lines, innumerable adjustments made to lighting and sound, and more was devoted to making the one acts a success. And indeed, a success it was.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So while I’m enjoying my evening filled with laughter, I find myself wondering: Why aren’t there more people here?</p>
<p>Time after time, theatre productions leave me in awe. Personally, I think students who aren’t at these drama events are missing out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A chorus of cheerful greetings echoed throughout the Northwest Auditorium as dining car waiters with buttery popcorn, charming country accents, and bright smiles ushered in the Northwest Theatre Department’s opening performance. The performing season kicked off with Irving Berlin’s western comedy “Annie Get Your Gun” Friday, Oct. 4 and 5 at 7 p.m., and Sunday, Oct. 6 at 2 p.m.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gun-totin’, sharp-shootin’ Annie Oakley falls in love with the star of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, Frank Butler, upon his arrival in town. Frank prefers a girl who is “as soft and as pink as a nursery,” however, much to Annie’s dismay. When Annie proves to be a better marksman than Frank, she lessens her chances of them being happy together even further. In the end, the two sharpshooters hold a rematch and Annie allows Frank to win the contest, but the competition ends up being a draw. Frank falls in love with Annie and the two sharpshooters get married.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Northwest presentation of “Annie Get Your Gun” was, simply put, delightful. The charismatic dining car waiters before the show left the audience anticipating more country style charm. They weren’t disappointed- the chemistry between cast members, the adept musical orchestra personnel and the overwhelming talent of the performers created the most entrancing atmosphere. Director Richard Lundin chose cast members for the show flawlessly and the students executed their roles just as well. As Frank Butler and Company said, there’s no business like show business- and certainly none like Northwest show business.</p>
