										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students around Northwest have many intriguing opinions on Donda vs CLB. Kanye West’s album “Donda” dropped on August 29, and Drake&#8217;s album “CLB or Certified Lover Boy” dropped on September 3. Creating an ongoing battle between who produced the better album.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students at Northwest have very strong opinions on which is better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donda is trash, that&#8217;s all I have to say,&#8221; Ethan Engelking (10) said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many students around Northwest agree with Engelking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CLB was better,” Tanner Martin (12)&nbsp; said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, by far Certified Lover Boy surpassed Donda at Northwest High School. But, not just at Northwest, CLB had sold 613,000 equivalent album units and, Donda only sold 309,000 album units. Declaring a winner in the CLB vs Donda battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
