										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Bring on the caffeine, because the PSAT is coming quickly. Make sure you are studied up and ready to go. The test will be Wednesday, Oct. 16.</p>
<p>You will still arrive at school at 8 a.m. but instead of going to your first hour, you will go to your advocacy class. The testing will go on for about two hours, and then you will continue with your regular classes, except the class periods will only last 45 minutes and the schedule will go 5th hour, 7th hour, 1st hour, and then you will end the day with 3rd hour.</p>
<p>The PSAT is a standardized test administered by the College Board and National Merit Scholarship Corporation. The scores from this test determine whether or not students qualify for the National Merit Scholarship Program.</p>
<p>Juniors usually take this test, but sophomores in honors English classes or AVID will take the PSAT as well.</p>
<p>Some seniors are also testing, but they’re testing on the ACT. All other seniors will be in the gym and auditorium for senior activities.</p>
<p>Freshmen will be taking the EXPLORE test in their advocacy class.</p>
<p>All other sophomores who are not in honors or AVID will be taking the PLAN test in their advocacy.</p>
<p>The PSAT focuses on writing skills, critical reading, and mathematics.</p>
<p>This test is mostly multiple choice; however, there are some free-response questions within the math section. Students are almost always allowed to use calculators for the mathematics section of the test.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Second of all, be prepared for some late nights, so get some caffeine.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Don’t just use one night to study, study a little bit at a time every night.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Even out your studying, go over a different section every night.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Take some notes on what you think will be on the test, it’s always good to be over-prepared.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Brush up on your vocabulary- read the whole dictionary before Wednesday! I’m joking, but seriously, look up some vocab words so you’re ready to take on that critical reading section.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Write practice essays, organizing your words and punctuation correctly. That way you can just breeze through the writing section when the test comes.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ask your math teacher for some worksheets to practice- I don’t know about you, but for me there’s always room for improvement when it comes to math.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Look over your PSAT study packet you received in your English class.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Go over the notes you took the morning of the test, that way it’s fresh in your mind.</p>
</li>
