										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northwest Fine Arts participated in an art showcase last weekend at Exploration Place. The Art teachers Andrea Corcoran, Michelle Jeffries, Tiffany Johnson, Craig Klinedinst and Drama teacher Richard Lundin teamed up with Choir teacher Amy Brown to show what their students had to offer.  </p>
<p>&#8220;What we hoped to gain form the Fine Arts showcase was exposure for our Northwest student artists,&#8221; Jeffries said. &#8220;The feeling of showing your work for others to enjoy is more than a small portion of why an artist creates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeffries says this was a great way to allow students to communicate their thoughts, feelings and ideas.</p>
<p>&#8220;This venue was free,” Jeffries said, “which was a great community connection on the part of Exploration Place. We hope to return to this same site next year.”</p>
<p>Exploration Place kept the entry fees. The Northwest students were the ones who inspired this event to take place.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a working artist I know the importance of being able to share your work,” said Jeffries, “each student who participated was allowed a chance to get their visual voice out there.”</p>
