										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">Athletes often say that their team feels like a family, but for this year&#8217;s varsity volleyball team, it was more than a feeling. The team had something happen to them that has never occurred before. This year there are three pairs of sisters all playing for the girls’ varsity volleyball team ranging all the way from freshman to senior. </span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Freshman Camdyn </span><span data-contrast="none">Stucky said her bond with her sister, junior Caiya Stucky has deepened by having her as a teammate.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;“W</span><span data-contrast="none">e have</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;been&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">close</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;our whole lives but being on the high school volleyball team brings something&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">totally new</span><span data-contrast="none">. Our relationship has grown so much, and I am so thankful for that,</span><span data-contrast="none">” Camdyn said.</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;Camdyn said she values this volleyball seas</span><span data-contrast="none">on since it is one of two that she gets to spend alongside her sister. The other sibling sets on the team were also very positive about how this experience impacts their relationships</span><span data-contrast="none">. They all mentioned that if all of them did not play for the same team, they felt as if the bond of the whole team had would have drastically changed. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;“</span><span data-contrast="auto">Having these sisters on our team definitely makes practices and honestly all of our time together so much more fun. Our whole team has grown to become family,</span><span data-contrast="auto">” sophomore Daetyn Bogle said.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Daetyn</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and her sister </span><span data-contrast="auto">Brailee</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Bogle both play for the varsity team. The both agreed that their connection is on another level since they have been playing together for five years. The sisters said they think the amount of time they have played together helps them understand each other on and off the court. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The other set of siblings on the team this year are the Corcoran sisters, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Jacqueline</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jaicee</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Jacqueline</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;is a&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">freshman</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;while her si</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto">ter&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jaicee</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;is a senior.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jacqueline said she was grateful for the board of education&#8217;s decision to allow fall sports so that she didn&#8217;t lose her only chance to be on the team with Jaicee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">The best thing about having my sister on the team is knowing&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">there is always&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">someone</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;to push you and knowing that we can’t take this season for granted. We didn’t think we would get to play at first and that made both&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jaicee</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and I really upset knowing this is our only year to get to play together, so when we got our season back we knew that we had to make it special.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The team ended their season as sub-state champions and in the top eight of the state in the 6A category with a record of 14-2. According to coach Adriana Leake, all of the other teams at state had gotten to play over 30 games this season while Northwest had played fewer games due to the late start for their season.</span></p>
<p>Leake said having sisters really modeled to the rest of the team how they could have strong disagreements, as siblings sometimes do, but then come back together. And she appreciated the increased communication.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nice because in a lot of ways the team chemistry was already built in,&#8221; Leake said.</p>
