<p><strong>Do you feel like your teachers have done a good job of preparing you for your finals?</strong><br />

<p><strong>What are your thoughts about finals?</strong><br />
Finals are usually a really stressful part of the school year.</p>
<p><strong>How have finals gone for you in the past years?</strong><br />
The past years&#8217; finals have been a little chaotic because I have them in every class but I feel accomplished after they are over with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">1.     <strong>Don&#8217;t even think about procrastinating.</strong> You may have been able to pull off three hundred point projects the night before in the past, but not now &#8212; not only do you not have recovery time if you flop, but with so many harder projects, you cannot afford to get bad grades on time-consuming but easy projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. <strong>Study.</strong> Find papers from the first quarter and conduct a short review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">3.     <strong>Prioritize.</strong> During the week before finals &#8212; the week where we are all reasonably sure that teachers are cackling in a room over the amount they assigned us, and it is not humanly possible to get everything done &#8212; deal with the classes you have the lowest grade in. Then deal with the big projects; you can probably do worksheets during class or during lunch, whereas big papers are difficult to work on in another class.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">4.     <strong>Take short breaks.</strong> In between two heavy subjects, read a chapter of a fluffy book that doesn’t have a plot that would weigh on your mind. Go on a run. Watch a 20-minute show on Netflix.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">5.     <strong>Don&#8217;t mess with your eating habits.</strong> You need to have constants, so if you are on a giant studying binge, don&#8217;t decide that breakfast is a good idea at four in the morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">6.     <strong>Caffeine.</strong> Although caffeine is not that great for you, and over time it actually lowers your energy levels, once in a while, it can work like a placebo. If you think you are getting an energy boost from that Sprite, you can fool yourself into thinking you are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">7.     <strong>Ask teachers for a look at what will be on the finals.</strong> That way you won&#8217;t waste time on stuff you don’t need to know.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">8.    This is probably the most useful tip: <strong>find people who have taken the course you are in.</strong> Ask them about what you can do &#8212; experience is the best teacher.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The finals policy might change next year for Northwest students. Students of all grades and class levels may be required to take finals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our district is planning on college career readiness,” principal Gil Alvarez said, “but no decisions are certain.” If finals are required the difficulty won’t change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Many schools in USD 259 are already requiring their students to take all their finals,” Alvarez said. “As far as I know all students will have to take finals in college.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The teachers also have some input. “The teaching staff has been asked to take a survey regarding finals policy,” said history teacher Dennis Cox. “It’s a disservice to the students not to prepare them.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once in college the students will have to take finals and in some cases midterms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Finals week tends to be much more stressful to students who haven’t taken them before,” Cox said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The students of Northwest are very opinionated on the subject.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I wouldn’t take any hard classes,” said sophomore Lien Vu.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some are irritated. “I’d be pretty mad,” said freshman Kelton Simkins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decision isn’t final, and they’re still debating the matter. For now the students will just continue the same procedures they have always done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Palms sweating. Legs shaking. Arms tingling. This is it. It’s coming. There’s no escaping it. You cant hide from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finals week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For years, finals have terrified many Northwest students. Luckily for them, the Northwest finals policy has never made them take the finals if they are passing and have 3 or less absences. However, the policy may be changing. The new principal, Mr. Alvarez is thinking of changing the policy, making it mandatory for all the students to take finals no matter what your grade is or how many absences you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some students are indifferent about the new policy while some are mad about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They should make it required,” said Jordyn Bibbs, sophomore. “Because you have to take them in college and I&#8217;m hoping more kids here want to go to college after high school. Its helping you get ready for that because if you never take finals you never know what to expect. You will expect a big test but you don&#8217;t exactly know what kind of questions and what kind of things you have to prepare for.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some students feel that they should make it mandatory, but with some sort of requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t think we should make finals mandatory until our senior year to at least prepare us one year for college to see what we can do.” said Caylin Cabral, sophomore . “If you have an A then you should not be forced to take it but if you can you can. But if you have an B or lower it should be mandatory no matter what because I don&#8217;t think absences matter.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some teachers are making their students take some kind of final in class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I&#8217;m making all of my students take the finals this year on the last day of class because if I can help them in some tiny way to make them take finals more seriously and not be scared of them then I feel that I think it’s important that they take the finals.” said Miss McDonald, history teacher. “Its not something to get out of or fear or hate it should be embraced by students to show the amount of information they&#8217;ve learned this year.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whether or not you have to take finals, don’t be afraid. They will come and pass. Just hang in there and remember, finals are not monsters in your closet.</p>
