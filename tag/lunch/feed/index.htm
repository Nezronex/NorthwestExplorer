										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conjoined lunches are new to returning Northwest students and have sparked a little concern throughout the school. Some students are worried about Covid spreading, not enough places to sit, and the long lunch lines. Cooper Schmitz, a junior, is one of many that agree with this.</p>
<p>“It’s weird. It’s a love-hate thing because there are too many people and it gets crowded. It’s also impossible to make a turn out of the school when I want to go somewhere,” Schmitz said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the downsides to the conjoined lunch, there are always ups. Freshman Aaliyah Clark likes the conjoined lunch.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a great way for people to socialize with all the upperclassmen. I also think that it is really crowded, there are always seats taken, and the lunch line is exceedingly long, and waiting in it is just a waste of time,” Clark said.</p>
<p>Many more students at Northwest can agree that the conjoined lunch isn’t the best because of the lack of seats and not enough time to get your lunch and eat it. Overall, they are many ups and downs that the conjoined lunch has brought to Northwest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since last year, students have worried about food sales at school because of changing nutrition guidelines. One of students’ primary concerns has been Bear Necessities. Administrator Walter Givens maintains that the store will still be fully operational.</p>
<p>“The Bear Necessities is selling many of the items that we sold last year,” Givens said.</p>
<p>Other clubs and organizations, however, will have to alter their fundraising routines.</p>
<p>“You have to be within those guidelines,” DECA advisor Jeff Darr said.  “But school clubs are allowed a couple of days each semester to still operate and sell items that are not within the federal guidelines. They have at least given us an opportunity to sell some of the things we’ve always sold, either through clubs or organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adjusting to the new regulations will be an ongoing process.</p>
<p>“It can have a huge impact on student groups that typically have made a lot of their money through the sale of food items at lunch,” Darr said. “It does force us to look at other non-food fundraising options that are out there.”</p>
<p>Darr is optimistic about the changes he may face during the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s good for us because we do have to eat healthier while we’re here,&#8221; Darr said. &#8220;We’re going to sell some tumblers for the first time ever; sports tumblers with KU or Wichita State or those type of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as pizza sales go, students should have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re still selling pizza. Just once we use our allotted number of days, we basically have to operate under the umbrella of the guidelines. I know Pizza Hut and Papa John&#8217;s have developed a pizza that meets the nutritional guidelines.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Going from Northwest my freshman year to Maize for my sophomore and junior year, I could tell there was a lot of differences between the two schools, like lunches, and coming back for my senior year, I can see very little has changed from the two years I was gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here, at Northwest, the 2 lunches here are 45 minutes long, counting the passing period, and students in grades 11 and 12 are allowed to leave for lunch as long as they prove when they come back that they are a junior or senior. For those that don’t leave for lunch and get school lunch, you go tell the lunch ladies exactly what you want and they bring it out to you. A lot of the times, there are students still waiting to get their lunches at the last 10 minutes of lunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taking a trip over to Maize for lunch, there were 3: A, B, and C. They are each 30 minutes long, not counting the passing period. Unlike Northwest, juniors and seniors are not allowed to leave for lunch. The lunch lines work a little different as well. Instead of the lunch ladies serving you the food you ask them for, Maize’s lunchrooms are a self-serve kind of line where you go in and choose everything you want, then you go to one of the 3 or 4 lunch check out lines where they just scan your ID and you move out and sit down. Most students are done getting lunch and sitting down, not by the last 10 minutes, but by the first 10 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There may only be small differences, but they make a big difference. More organization in the lunchroom here at Northwest could save a lot of time. Can I do anything about that myself? Probably not. As a senior, I don’t eat lunch in the school anyway, so it doesn’t affect me in the end!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">At the beginning of the school year, administrators changed the structure of the lunch line from individual lines behind each window to one line that leads to a staff member who then directs you to a window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Principal Gil Alvarez says the new system has helped reduce cutting and speed up the process of getting lunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It takes 5 minutes and 30 seconds max from the back of the line now to get to the window,” Alvarez said. “When you’re talking time-wise, it’s obviously improved. Additionally, the systematic structure is what makes it easier to see the cutting.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sophomore Kole Parker doesn’t agree that the system has improved, however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s going to take at least 20 minutes to get your food, 20 minutes to eat it and you’re already done,” Parker said. “You have no time to talk to anybody. They used it to make people not cut anybody, but it just helps people cut in line. For example, for me, I just walked up to the front of the line.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alvarez argues that the appearance of the line is what turns the students away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The frustration of seeing the line makes people think it’s going to take longer, when in actuality, it’s much shorter.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alvarez, along with other administrators, decided that the old lunch program wasn’t functional due to all the cutting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was actually getting to the point of probably 5 minutes until the bell rings and people weren’t even eating,” Alvarez said. “So we had to look for different systems.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biology instructor Jonathan Thompson, who helps direct the students to the lunch windows, approves of the new lunch system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It works much better,” Thompson said. “The kids get through lines quicker, it’s organized, and it works well.”</p>
