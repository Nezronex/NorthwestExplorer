										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a disease throwback to the measles just this year, it seems more and more people are listening to celebrities for medical advice. It’s too easy to take status as authority in this day and age, and ignore the potential risks. </p>
<p>Students are required to get the necessary vaccinations to attend public school, but have the option to opt out for religious reasons. However, even the more conservative religions (i.e. amish) have been permitting, even encouraging vaccinations in the past decades.</p>
<p>The only real opposition comes from public figures like Gwyneth Paltrow, who believes her feelings can alter the molecular structure of water, obviously a very well-versed woman in the area of science. </p>
<p>Anti-vax parents blame vaccinations for many disabilities and ailments, despite experts refuting this time and time again, the most popular, and seemingly only, study supporting these claims has been admitted, by the scientist Mark Geier, to be false, as well as dismissed by The Institute of Medicine.</p>
<p>Many parents still are still wary of the unnatural ingredients in vaccines, such as preservatives, and the risk of deadly allergic reactions to the vaccines. However, the risk is less than a hundredth of a percent for a child to go into anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p>The preservative in vaccines, thimerosal, that was believed to cause autism has been subject to countless studies, and has overwhelmingly been proved a myth, and is no longer present in many new vaccinations.</p>
<p>This spread of false information is not only detrimental to the unvaccinated children, and all the people they put at risk, but to individuals with disabilities like autism as well. It makes it seems as if they have something wrong with them.</p>
<p>The only medical risk that would get it the way of vaccination is if a child were to have an autoimmune disorder and aren’t strong enough to receive the vaccinations. This disorder also makes them more susceptible to diseases, giving even more reason to get other children vaccinated.</p>
<p>It should be a public duty to vaccinate, as the benefits heavily outweigh the risks. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A case of measles was linked to Disneyland in December. Since then, the state of California has  linked 51 cases to the amusement park.<br />
But that’s in the golden state. What do Northwest students have to worry about? </p>
<p>The state of Kansas requires that every pupil enrolled in any school must have proof of “proper tests and inoculations,” according to the National Vaccine Information Center. Students can be exempt from these requirements, however, for medical reasons (vaccinations endanger the child) or for religious ones (religious teachings oppose such tests or inoculations). </p>
<p>Here, there are several students who have received exemptions for these reasons. And for the most part, the virus spreads among those who haven’t been vaccinated&#8211;this was the case for 82% of those infected in California. The respiratory disease is spread through the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat.</p>
<p>Besides these reasons, parents have prohibited their children from being vaccinated for the fear of putting the child at a higher risk for autism. A 1998 study conducted by former doctor Andrew Wakefield suggested a connection between vaccinations and the development of autism spectrum disorder. Wakefield himself and the CDC have since then denied the existence of a link between the medicine and the disorder, but the publication has made a lasting impression on parents not versed in scientific literature. </p>
<p>“There’s a lot of misinformation out there about the side effects from the immunizations,” school nurse Terry Magana said. </p>
<p>It’s been proven, though, that vaccines do not cause autism. Most importantly, it’s been proven that the MMR vaccine works.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MMR vaccine) are more than 99 percent effective in preventing measles,&#8221; the California health department said in a press release.</p>
<p>Magana stresses the significance of discussing these issues with experts in the medical field. </p>
<p>“Parents really need to discuss it with their physicians,” Magana said. “Not only for their health, but for everyone around them too. It’s a community issue, it’s not just that one child’s issue. A lot of parents really don’t think about that.”</p>
