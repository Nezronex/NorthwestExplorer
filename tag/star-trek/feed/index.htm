										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Altgilbers is a freshman at Northwest high school who enjoys academics. He enjoys academics&nbsp; like history, drama, reading, and even studying things like military and politics. He has his thoughts on Trump, music, and movies like everyone else.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers listens country music and likes it over other music. He has a disliking for modern music. Altgilbers states modern music is artificial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Modern music just seems excessively artificial to me” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers likes to read, learn about history, do drama, study military on the weekends, and meatloaf. He enjoys drama because he enjoys putting on theater. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The class I am most interested in is drama because I very much enjoy putting on theatre,” Altigilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like everyone else, Altgilbers has his thoughts on politics and Trump himself. He thinks Trump isn’t good at what he does but has some good points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thoughts on Trump are that he&#8217;s really not good at anything he does, unless he&#8217;s creating chaos. He&#8217;s very good at that. Some more thoughts on Trump are that he was pretty competent as a businessman, but not as a president,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers is a fan of Star Trek and there is one movie he prefers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Star Trek VI is my favorite movie because it has my favorite things and tells a great story with them: sci-fi, diplomacy, and rogue generals.”</span></p>
