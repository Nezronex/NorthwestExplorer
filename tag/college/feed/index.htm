										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepping for college applications or making the dream sports team may be the next step for some after high school. Some students are not aware of the effect their online presence can have on their college plans.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students’ social media outputs can influence admission counselors or coaches to decline or revoke a scholarship because of what students  post on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook. According to Kaplan Test Prep’s 2013 Survey, 30 percent of college admissions officers found something online about an applicant that negatively affected their application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why college career coordinator Danea Cramer cautions against posting questionable material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you&#8217;re saying you are one thing on an application and then on social media you&#8217;re being inappropriate,” Cramer said “[colleges] probably won’t give that money to you because you&#8217;re not putting yourself in a very good light,” college career coordinator Danea Cramer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Northwest, head basketball coach Bryan Chadwick has a Twitter for the basketball team where coaches could have access to a player’s social media account. They will soon have an Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are just being smart, being proactive because you don&#8217;t want that stuff to catch up with you,” Chadwick said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For head football coach Steve Martin, reviewing a student&#8217;s account can occur when someone brings attention the the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those people and myself are looking at their profiles. I have had a parent or another teacher that follows a kid and says ‘hey coach, you might wanna look what this guy has on his profile’,” Martin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been parents that have brought attention to what their child or other student&#8217;s post. Online material considered inappropriate can range from violent to offensive posts or in relation of abusing drugs or alcohol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a strict drug policy here at Northwest when it comes to athletics,” Martin said. “Maybe they might not be a drug user or some of their friends might be, one of the big things is that they tie themselves into it just to try to be cool.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These actions affect everyone in other colleges around the U.S also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have seen it on ESPN  where college coaches have taken away scholarships. There was a kid out of Michigan. There was a kid out of Arkansas.They don’t want character issues,” Chadwick said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chadwick’s assertion is true. In 2012, football player Yuri Wright was expelled from Don Bosco Prep high School in Ramsey, N.J.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of racial and sexually graphic Twitter posts. He also lost  his scholarship to Michigan University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Putting a thought or feeling out there for everyone to see can lead to huge consequences. Junior Samantha Gould has found this out the hard way where she would soon learn to think about posting every thought or feeling on the internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would turn into a huge mess, Gould said. “I drifted away from a lot of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General admission for colleges sometimes do not look into students social media accounts.They just look to see if that student meets criteria, but if they are applying for a private college or a scholarship, they can choose to look up that student to see what they are posting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scholarship money is a gift,” Cramer said. “It&#8217;s nothing you have to pay back. So that can be anywhere from $250 to $2000 or more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin warns against risking this gift for likes or retweets, because mistakes online can be irreversible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Internet is a dictionary,” Martin said. “It&#8217;s an encyclopedia of your past.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to go to college? Do you want to make something out yourself? Do you want to be able to say “I made it”? Well you can. Whether you want to be bold and spontaneous and go out of state to discover something new, or to stay close to home and keep that familiarity feeling, you can make it happen. Here are the steps that will help make that dream a reality.      </p>
<p>Freshman: Freshman, this is the fresh start that some of you have been waiting for. This is the first step to getting that diploma and starting the rest of your lives. Here is a checklist to see what you need to do to stay on track.</p>
<p>Community Service: You will thank yourself later; colleges look for people are active in their communities, so start now to get ahead of the crowd.<br />
Keep your grades up: This year maybe your first year in high school, but in many ways its the most important year. If you get good grades from the get go you won’t have to worry later on.<br />
Start thinking about something you want to do when you grow up: If you start thinking about your dream career now you will have an advantage because that will open up doors and opportunities to start looking for.<br />
 Start to prepare a college resume for yourself: include accomplishments, rewards, and recognitions.</p>
<p>Sophomore: Sophomores, you have officially surpassed the freshman year and now you are one step closer to getting that diploma. Here are some things that will let you know if you’re still on the path to success.</p>
<p>Start attending college and career informational events: If you have no idea where you want to go or even what you want to do, then this step is for you. These informational events will help make your choice a little bit clearer, so when you go to these events at the end rate it from 1-10 on how well you liked it.<br />
Start researching funding for school: This is the best year to start looking into how much school is going to cost. Another thing that you should be aware of, are scholarships, grants, and loans.<br />
Mentoring: Now lets say you already know what you want to do, start looking for mentors that are apart of the field, you plan on pursuing one day. This will help you begin to understand the process of the job.<br />
PSAT practice test: The PSAT is an optional test for sophomores, but highly recommended, to prepare for Junior year, where scholarship money is included to the highest scores.</p>
<p>Junior: Well Juniors you are literally more than halfway to that cap and gown, YAY. But you’re not quite there yet, so don’t start slacking because you still have more than a year left to continue to prove to your dream school that you are worthy of attending. </p>
<p>Fall:<br />
Take the PSAT: This test qualifies you for the  National Merit scholarships and programs, and is highly recommended to take for scholarship opportunities.<br />
Attend college fairs: This step will bring clarity to the questions you may have for a college or many colleges.<br />
Explore Careers: Lets face it in about a year in a half you will literally be living on your own and finally starting your life. So it’s best for you to be looking, if you don’t already know, for the career that you plan on having for a very long time. My advice to you, is to try to find something that you like, or else you will be very miserable.<br />
Take the ACT/SAT(East Coast Schools Only): Take the ACT in the fall/winter so that if you don’t do so well you can always have time to study, to take it again in the spring.<br />
Spring<br />
 Research ways to pay for college: Now we all know that college is extremely expensive and that scholarships can only get you so far, so look up ways to save money so that in the end you can say, “yes I’m paying my way through school”.<br />
Start looking into scholarships: This is where the money is people, so look into it, see what you qualify for, and pay attention to deadlines.<br />
Contact Colleges: Contact the colleges that you are interested in, to get more information on them, for example, what you need to even get into the college.<br />
DON’T GIVE UP: This is the year that grades are most important because, these are probably going to be the last grades that the college will see, so “Go big or Go home”.</p>
<p>Senior:  Well you made it, you literally are less than 6 months away from saying goodbye to high school forever.</p>
<p>Summer<br />
Narrow down colleges: Narrow down your top 3 colleges.<br />
Start college visits: Well lets say you have narrowed down your colleges to your top 3, this is the step, that should put everything into perspective.<br />
Enter FAFSA: This will help big time, this  helps find out how much financial support you will receive.</p>
<p>Fall<br />
College Applications: Get these filled out, and pay attention to deadlines. This is how you will have any chance of getting in.<br />
Scholarships: Look, look, look, these things give money. Pay attention to deadlines.<br />
Request transcripts and letters of recommendation: With letters of recommendation, this will help the colleges help understand what kind of student you are. The transcripts will be the grades you worked so hard to get.<br />
Meet with counselor: Your counselor will help make sure you have all the credits you need to graduate.<br />
Register for Federal Aid Pin: This will also help with financial need.</p>
<p>Spring<br />
College Acceptance: Keep you eyes open for those acceptance letters.<br />
Make your final decision: This is it, this is the time to make that decision that will change your life forever. So choose wisely.<br />
Be happy with your choice Whatever you choose, choose it because YOU want it, not anybody else.</p>
<p>Well this is the checklist that will make that dream of starting your life on a good note possible. My final words to you, are not to be afraid, and to NEVER give up just because your dream is to far away and too big to tackle, life has this crazy way of always having everything work out in the end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northwest’s first Lunch and Learn was held last Tuesday in the CCC. Nineteen students gathered to listen to Suzy Thompson talk about what it&#8217;s really like to be a physical therapist.</p>
<p>Lunch and Learn offers a look into possible career choices for students by bringing in various professionals to discuss the everyday details of their job.</p>
<p>During first lunch on each third Tuesday of the month, students may meet in the CCC to listen to these area professionals.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of students that may join. If the discussions are successful, more meetings may be scheduled.</p>
<p>“Ms.Terriere  and I really wanted to set up the chance for students to talk to someone that does a real job,” College Career Coordinator Danea Cramer  said . “Not read about it or talk to someone from human resources, but actually sit down and say ‘What’s your day like? When you go to work, what’s the first thing you do? How do you determine how to manage your day? Where did you go to college? Do you need to go to college to do this job?”</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning about a potential career, see Cramer in room A26.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 dir="ltr">It&#8217;s time to make scholarships your focus!</h1>
<p dir="ltr">You can find opportunities through nonprofit organizations, and small and large companies. Ask your employer, your parent’s employer, and your church. You never know where an opportunity may exist.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What should you do?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Schedule time in your week to work on scholarship applications. It can quickly feel overwhelming, so take a look at your schedule and plug it in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Utilize websites to find scholarships some examples being:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cappex.com/">www.cappex.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.studentscholarships.org/">www.studentscholarships.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fastweb.com/">www.fastweb.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>(Make sure you don’t pay anyone or any site a fee for scholarships. That can be a sign of a scam.)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Check out your community colleges.</strong> Most community colleges offer activity scholarships that can pay up to books and tuition. Activities may include athletics, music, drama, yearbook, newspaper, photography, writing, being a student ambassador, or being a leader! Attend a community college and receive your first couple of years of college for close to free!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Anything else?</h2>
<ul>
<li> Check out the CCC fusion page, it also has a list of scholarship opportunities that the school has received. Make sure to check it out!</li>
<li> You can also feel free to stop by the CCC to discuss your plans and see what scholarships you may qualify for, passes can be given by Danea Cramer in A-26 for advocacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow the CCC @nw_ccc on Twitter for all of the latest information related to life after high school. </strong></p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Upcoming Scholarships Deadlines:</h3>
<ul>
<li>November 1 – KSU and KU</li>

<li><a href="http://www.zinch.com/">www.zinch.com</a></li>
<li>Scholarships can also be found on the CCC fusionpage.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><em>You must apply for admission and be accepted to qualify for scholarships. This is done by applying for admission, paying the application fee and sending your transcript and ACT scores.</em></p>
<h1 dir="ltr">The ACT</h1>
<h3 dir="ltr">Deadlines and Dates</h3>
<ul>
<li>The deadline for the December 14 ACT is Friday, November 8.</li>
<li>WSU will be hosting an ACT Prep Workshop on November 16. The cost is $32. Register on-line at <a href="http://www.registerblast.com/wsu">www.registerblast.com/wsu</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Select colleges that you want  to receive your ACT scores and make sure to upload your photo when registering.</li>
<li>There is an app for iPhones, iPads, and Android devices that allows you upload your picture in less than a minute. If you prefer, you can stop by the CCC in A-26 and upload it there.</li>
<li>When you register for the ACT it is extremely important to select the colleges you want to see your scores, as ACT scores will no longer appear on your transcript, so therefore Northwest can no longer send them to colleges for you.</li>

If you have not visited colleges that you are interested in, now is the time to do that. Visiting campus allow you get a “feel” for the environment of the college. For many students, the campus visit is the deciding factor on whether or not they attend that college. When scheduling the visit, make sure to give the college two weeks notice that your requests can be made. You can choose to tour the campus, see the residence halls, meet with a professor, speak with financial aid, etc. You can make it how you want it.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Career Fits</h1>
<h3>Struggling to figure out your career fit? Check out these websites for personality &amp; career assessments.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Holland Code Assessment. The Holland Code theory explains work-related behavior such as, which career choices are likely to lead to job success and satisfaction. It also explains other human actions, like success and satisfaction in school and training programs.<br />
