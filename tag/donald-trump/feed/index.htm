<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the incline of discriminatory acts that have occurred after the announcement of the new president of the United states, a few Northwest students decided to hold a protest, or peace rally as participants like to identify , before school on the 14th of November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t really like the term ‘protest’. We used the word ‘peace rally’ because protest just has a lot of negative connotations,” said junior Hailey Colborn. “It was a rally for unity, positivity and peace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside many others, Colborn doesn&#8217;t understand why the rally received backlash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[People] should understand an event before [they] automatically take a stance,” said Colborn. “Because if they would&#8217;ve listened, the only thing we were trying to do was promote equality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colborn even claims that while some parents honked at them for support, others flipped them off while being visibly annoyed. Junior Emerson Ross was also a participate of the peace rally that supported the idea of spreading equality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was basically something to show people that everyone should learn to love each other and not hate,” said Ross. “Although we are minors and we can&#8217;t vote, we are still affected by discrimination and we are showing [others] that we do have a voice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He too does not understand why the rally, that was suppose to promote peace, received negative comments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It didn&#8217;t make sense, because if you don&#8217;t like a protest against discrimination that&#8217;s basically saying that you are for discrimination and that&#8217;s terrible,” said Ross. “Why would you want to belittle someone over the way that they are, over the way they’re born?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Keaton Fish states that he is ‘not against a group of students standing up for what they believe in’ but does believe that the peace rally was slightly inappropriate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Driving into the school and seeing all those people, just knowing that it was more about the election than what they would like to say it was,” said Fish. “It kinda felt like they were trying to call us out and say that we were racist or homophobic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes that the protest date was ‘conveniently’ right after the election and that the protestors should have postponed the rally until the drama revolving around President elect Donald Trump died down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they would&#8217;ve waited I, myself, would&#8217;ve gladly stood out there with them and supported [their cause],” said Fish. “But because of what has been going on at the same time, it felt more like it was an attack politically than it was a standup for peace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fish turned 18 during the spring and took the opportunity to vote for Donald Trump. And although Colborn was an organizer of the peace rally she claims to not have a stance against either presidential candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not taking like a pro-trump or anti-trump stance on anything,” said Colborn. “Quite frankly, I don&#8217;t even know what party I&#8217;m in because I’m only 16 years old.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the peace rally did receive some objection, so have a few Trump supporters. “[Donald Trump] has made very racist comments, he has made very sexist comments,” admitted Fish. “But because I don&#8217;t agree with what [Hillary Clinton] was saying, people automatically think that the words that he said came out of my mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many students who are Trump supporters still believe that this peace rally was more of a political protest than what the participants would like to admit. While on the other hand, protesters believe that they were just showing everyone to spread love not hate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the question if Ross would participate in future rallies he says,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fight&#8217;s not over in ending discrimination. And until that fight is over, I want to make sure that I&#8217;m a part of that fight to spread love.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every so often, a person comes into the public eye who is so unusual that we can’t help but stare. Sometimes, it’s for purposefully brazen statements, designed to draw attention (Lady Gaga comes to mind), and sometimes the spectacle is simply a way of life we cannot understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed to me that the reason for Donald Trump’s continuing momentum in the presidential race was some combination of the two: his provocative proposals stand out amidst the (somewhat) carefully considered plans for gradual change that seem to constitute many campaign platforms, and his loudmouthed, flashy, frequently rude nature makes him a source of entertainment in the political arena. People watch him because they are shocked by him, because they do not understand him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when I joined the line of thousands waiting to hear him speak in person, I was not surprised to see protesters in the dozens, wielding signs that read “Stop the Hate” and “No Racism, No Trump.” One girl among a group of Bernie Sanders supporters tirelessly asked every person in line why they were there &#8212; any response indicating support for Trump yielded a rapid volley of questions, most of which began with “Why?” I felt inclined to shout along with them, to call out the injustices I’d observed from debate clips and Twitter screenshots, even as I attempted to maintain an objective view of the events before me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I was stunned to see masses of people who genuinely support this man as a candidate for the highest office in the land. Poll numbers repeatedly show his popularity, and ten states have chosen him over the other Republican candidates, but no piece of evidence could have prepared me for the sight of such overwhelming support, and from such a wide demographic of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d pictured most Trump patrons as people very similar to him: people who speak their opinions loudly, without regard for what other people think; people who call to mind words such as “tacky”, “rude”, and “uneducated”; people who are, for the most part, older and white. But I was wrong. And I was guilty of the same stereotyping that makes so many people seethe with anger at Trump’s words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There certainly wasn’t a shortage of those people I’d pictured &#8212; many sported t-shirts, hats, and buttons emblazoned with his grinning face and his directive to “Make America Great Again.” But what I hadn’t foreseen was the quiet old man who proudly showed a security guard a picture of him and his wife in front of their little blue house, and said that that very picture was what had gotten him a letter back from the “very busy man” he’d sent it to. I hadn’t imagined the young girl who eagerly tugged on her father’s arm and told him “We’re almost there! We’re gonna see Mr. Trump!” as the line inched closer to the door. The young couple dressed for church, the man holding a cardboard sign with “Vietnam Vets for Trump” sharpied on it, the Hispanic family waving and cheering as he came onstage &#8212; none of them were part of the mental construct I’d made of “Trump supporters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His words still grated on me, and quite apparently on the many others who’d attended the rally with the ulterior motive of shouting their disapproval at crucial moments in his speech. I took it somewhat personally when he asserted that the press are “the most dishonest people in the world, I tell ya!”, citing an incident when a station “beeped out” the end of a sentence even though he’d supposedly said nothing. And I was compelled to cringe and turn away when he boasted that his infamous wall on the U.S.-Mexico border would indeed be funded by the Mexican government, and that it would grow ten feet higher at every protest they’d make, drawing cheers throughout the crowded exhibition hall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the disbelief and even contempt I’d felt for his supporters has disappeared, replaced with a feeling of distant understanding. I get why so many people flock to this man who makes his impressions with displays of wealth and power. I get why people cheer at his radical proposals, the ideas that make conservatives and liberals alike stare in disbelief. He’s unashamed of speaking his mind, regardless of how people may receive his words, and people admire him for that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still think some of those people are blind to just how dangerous Trump is. I think his loud mouth and brash plans will put this nation in trouble if he gets elected, and his supporters don’t see that. Or maybe they don’t care. But they are free to support whoever they choose, and I see now that they’re not completely unjustified in putting their faith in the reality star-turned-politician. It’s not a smart move in my books, but it’s a move they have the right to make.</span></p>
