										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pie Five is a pizzeria located on S. Ridge Rd, next to Lowes and Applebees; and I have to say that I was fairly impressed. The walk in was extremely similar to Chipotle’s, and the wait was just as long. Walking in, there is a long walkway towards the left and forward to the order area. i felt relaxed, the opposite feeling you get at a sports bar. I could relax, and have quiet conversation with my friend.  </p>
<p>Seating was like your typical Chipotle setup, but with more crimson, grey and white opposed to Chipotle’s maroon and brick red. The cool, calm environment gave me the opportunity to focus on my food and friend.</p>
<p>At the counter, you select how you want your pizza. From all the cheeses, different meat and vegetables toppings; the true definition of personal panned. Contrast to the stereotypical pizza, the crust here was quite doughy. The meat on it was crafted to crispiness, and the cheese melted into the sauce like ice cream in the summer. The pizza was so life changing, I had an epiphany every bite. I’d rate the pizzeria at a 4 out of 5 stars, based off of the pizza service, and restaurant comfortability. I’d definitely recommend it for anyone searching for that “next level” of pizza. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I Stay, a film starring Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley, is an unconventional love story about a cellist and a rock star whose love is put under strain by a life disaster. Mia (Chloe Grace) and her family were in a brutal car crash that left her in a coma and the rest of her family dead. The movie is based off the idea that your destiny is what you choose. She is able to hear and see everything that goes on around her unresponsive body, and is left to make the choice to move on or to stay alive.<br />
The movie was based off of the novel by Gayle Forman, and stuck closely to the plot of the book. Since If I Stay is one of my favorite books, I rushed to see it in film. There’s something about seeing the emotion play out on screen that hits you harder than any printed words could. This movie shows the raw emotion of family, friends, and personal struggles that come from a major life change, such as death. The sorrow and passion hits you like a brick to the face. If you go see this movie and have anything short of a heart of ice, you will be in tears. If you are anything like me, you will need a life jacket to swim out of your tears.<br />
This movie is a must see for the season. Whether you are in need of a good cry, or just want to torture your sappy significant other, this movie will give you your sentimental fix. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">During our three days of snow, I decided to watch Netflix-lots of Netflix. After scrolling through my comfort shows, starting a new show sounded like a good idea since I had three days to binge and drool over said show if I liked it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the description, Chuck is a show about a guy named Chuck who is an underachiever who gets government secrets downloaded into his head and turns into a government asset. The description alone was what made me avoid it: it sounded dumb. So I went in thinking it would be something like the people who wrote a sitcom trying their hand at a grittier type of show.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was wrong. Completely wrong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck is a person who got kicked out of Stanford unfairly who has had all of his confidence crushed by working at a California version of Best Buy and is the head of the Nerd Herd, a group who goes out and fixes computers. His ex-best friend who turns out to be a rogue government agent sends him an email that uses embedded pictures to implant government secrets into his head-and then the only computer holding the secrets now in Chuck&#8217;s head is destroyed.  A CIA agent, Sarah Walker (the love interest) and NSA agent John Casey are sent to protect him-but they soon realize the only way to use the information for good is to take him on missions with them, forcing Chuck to balance his spy life and real life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The characters were great and likable.  Chuck is sweet and has a strong moral code, which conflicts often with the wants of the CIA, and makes for a likeable lead character. Sarah is an agent who uses her looks to go undercover, which distracts from the fact she is highly trained in martial artist with relationship issues.  John Casey is a tough, trigger-happy  NSA agent with a fearsome demeanor. Together, the three of them form a triad of awesome  to head up the “A” plot line. His sister, her fiance Devon (More commonly known as ‘Captain Awesome’, from the family of ‘Very Awesomes), his best friend Morgan and the Nerd Herd usually form the “B” plot, which is what is happening in Chuck’s real life and usually pretty goofy. Sometime in the episode, both storylines collide forcing Chuck to cover for himself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The show is smart, funny, and engaging. No character is useless and the show throws out plenty of jokes without sacrificing plot. By the end of the episode, you wonder how on earth they packed so much into one episode, and it is addictive. I burst out laughing several times, whether it was at Captain Awesome’s horrible lying skills (“I didn’t pick up my phone because I was decapitating a bear!) or Casey saying everything in the same grating voice.  (“Don’t puke on the C4”) No line is wasted and you end up falling in love with the characters, no matter how bad they screw up. And every character grows, so the show never gets stale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Verdict: I loved it. Normally crime shows bore me, but I was able to sit through episode after episode, which makes itself the first show that has not been sci-fi/fantasy to make me do that. This is such an underrated show that deserves to have a bigger fanbase than it does. It’s on Netflix, so I would recommend going home and watching it-if you think you can stop at one.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIqEWRt8sBo">How to be a deadly spy according to John Casey</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Quote from the show:</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t do that, because I have two protectors that will come running with guns blazing when they hear my girly scream”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Uncle Joe’s Pizzeria recently opened across the street from Northwest High School, where Talliano’s Pizzeria was previously located.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like any other average teenagers, a friend and I were hungry after school, so we decided to go try this new place out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Walking into the pizzeria shortly after school, we saw that it was very, very slow&#8230; But it is still very new, so not many people have heard much about it. Being the only people in the pizzeria at this time, though, we got to talk to the owner a little bit about the restaurant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The owner asked if we were students from Northwest, and, of course, we told him yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">He asked what time our lunches start. “First lunch starts at 10:47 and second lunch starts at 12:14,” we told him. He said he thought it was pretty early, but was considering opening up the pizzeria around 10:30 instead of 11:00 so students could venture across the street for some pizza for lunch. He was always ready to open at that time anyway. Since the pizzeria is still fairly new, it would be a good start to getting a little more business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for the food?</p>
<p>There is a salad bar, pizza buffet, pasta, calzones, anything you’d expect to see at a pizza place. They’ll even ask you if you have any special requests for pizzas for the buffet! I personally think the pizza is great, but the customer service could use some work. To the girl that took my order, please try not to look so mad next time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A chorus of cheerful greetings echoed throughout the Northwest Auditorium as dining car waiters with buttery popcorn, charming country accents, and bright smiles ushered in the Northwest Theatre Department’s opening performance. The performing season kicked off with Irving Berlin’s western comedy “Annie Get Your Gun” Friday, Oct. 4 and 5 at 7 p.m., and Sunday, Oct. 6 at 2 p.m.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gun-totin’, sharp-shootin’ Annie Oakley falls in love with the star of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, Frank Butler, upon his arrival in town. Frank prefers a girl who is “as soft and as pink as a nursery,” however, much to Annie’s dismay. When Annie proves to be a better marksman than Frank, she lessens her chances of them being happy together even further. In the end, the two sharpshooters hold a rematch and Annie allows Frank to win the contest, but the competition ends up being a draw. Frank falls in love with Annie and the two sharpshooters get married.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Northwest presentation of “Annie Get Your Gun” was, simply put, delightful. The charismatic dining car waiters before the show left the audience anticipating more country style charm. They weren’t disappointed- the chemistry between cast members, the adept musical orchestra personnel and the overwhelming talent of the performers created the most entrancing atmosphere. Director Richard Lundin chose cast members for the show flawlessly and the students executed their roles just as well. As Frank Butler and Company said, there’s no business like show business- and certainly none like Northwest show business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 11, 2013, the Syfy channel released its new original movie, Sharknado. This movie was very helpful in dealing with a Sharknado, if you ever have the opportunity of experiencing one. Without a doubt this was one of the best movies of 2013 and deserves an Oscar for both acting and animation.</p>
<p>That’s what I would say if Syfy was paying me to do this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sharknado wasn&#8217;t Syfy’s finest movie. Along with a lot of puns and horrible CGI sharks, you&#8217;re pretty much wasting an evening. Ian Ziering, who was also in the TV show Beverly Hills 90210, plays our hero Fin Shepard (the hero’s name is Fin, and this is a movie about sharks- this is very fishy), the owner of a popular bar. With the help of his ex-wife and his bar employees, they speed around Los Angeles trying to save people from the dreaded flying sharks and also robbing convenience stores for their guns and chainsaws along the way. I don&#8217;t want to spoil the ending for you, but let’s just say that thanks to this movie we now know how to stop a Sharknado. Thanks Syfy!</p>
<p dir="ltr">The premiere of Sharknado gained around 2.1 million views and over 5,000 tweets per minute on Twitter. That’s a lot of hype for a poorly made movie. Thanks to all the views, Syfy has announced that they will be making a sequel. With the help of Twitter, the title  for the sequel is Sharknado 2: The Second One. They plan on releasing it next summer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite how amazingly bad it is, you should watch it at least once. It’s a cult classic. Sharknado has been released on DVD and is still currently being replayed on the Syfy channel. Who knows? Maybe this movie will come in handy someday when we experience our own Sharknado.</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Side note: I actually love this movie and I’m just poking fun at its mistakes. It’s a really great movie and I really think that you should watch it.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 7th movie in the Harry Potter series is probably the movie with the highest expectations by far. The previous movie ended in the middle of the action and excitement, and Deathly Hallows picked it right back up. Shortly after the curtains went up, the curses were flying though the air and people were falling off their broomsticks. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) along with his loyal friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), continue what Dumbledore started. The trio tries to find the horcruxes, objects that make Voldemort immortal. Once the horcruxes are destroyed the three will be able to kill Voldemort once and for all. But Voldemort is not going to make it easy for them.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord&#8217;s power is growing stronger every day. One of Voldemort’s followers gets announced to the new Minister of Magic. The ministry puts up &#8220;Wanted” posters with big rewards for whoever catches Harry. So he hides and cannot show himself to the public and can’t trust anyone but his closest friends. After Harry’s principal, mentor and good friend Dumbledore died, he left small clues to the next horcruxes, leaving Harry and his friends to figure it out.</p>
<p>They spend most of their days in a tent in the forest and get their friendship tested. The romance between Ron and Hermione keeps appearing, but as Hermione and Harry spend a lot of time together, Ron starts to get very jealous.</p>
<p>Even though this may sound cliché for some audiences, the movie (that lasts for almost 2 and a half hours) has a lot of action, combined with romance, friendship and mystery. The last few movies have missed many important scenes from the books, making it hard to follow and understand the magic world J.K. Rowling created. This time, director David Yates decided to split the book in two movies and made sure to tell the whole story. But why didn&#8217;t he think of this earlier? Having read the book, seeing many of the scenes from the book also in the movie was pleasant. But I also believe it makes for a better movie for those who haven’t read the book. All over, this was a very good movie and I can&#8217;t wait for the second part.</p>
