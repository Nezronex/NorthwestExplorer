										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The last book club meeting found the members eating snacks, playing games and discussing Divergent. This month they met again to discuss The Help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Help is a book set in the 1960’s about a group of black maids working in Jackson, Miss.  A young writer wants to tell their story and finds out about who these women are and what they do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In celebration of the book, the club ate some tasty chocolate cake, discussed the book and watched the award-winning movie adaption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new book for this month is entitled “All the Truth That’s in Me” by Julie Berry. Taking place in an unnamed historical setting, the award-winning novel tells the story of a girl who cannot talk after having part of her tongue cut out by her captor of two years.</p>
