Watson and other representatives from the Department of Education visited Machine Tools 1, taught by Bryan Jones, members of the Pro-Start program led by Alison Draut, and Jeff Darr’s Marketing Research class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watson hoped to measure how his visions of teaching both college readiness and employability skills are being carried out in the classrooms. Northwest was the place to visit in part because of the 38-40 CTE courses it offers, including 14-18 different career pathways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Oborny, Entrepreneurship Task Force (ETF) co-chair attested to the success of the business pathway at Northwest. He credits the growth of an elementary school business program, from one competition to now three competitions, to Northwest DECA. This initiative was led by seniors Matthew Colborn, Kyle Wegleitner, Dakota West. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DECA and Northwest High has been very helpful in developing that program and also starting to scale it,” Oborny said. “They’ve done a great job, represented their age group really well and done tremendous service to the community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draut’s Pro-Start program has achieved similar success. In her classroom, recently renovated to reflect the equipment used in real commercial restaurant facilities, students are able to earn industry-recognized certificates. Junior Nicole Shartzer was able to earn two promotions at her job thanks to the certification earned in class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neely Carson, who serves on the CTE advisory committee, says this is exactly what the CTE program hopes to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all about cultivating the next group of leaders within our industries,” Carson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principal Gil Alvarez is pleased to see the commissioner’s vision being achieved within the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you talk about college and career ready skills, employability skills, the critical thinking, the problem solving, the collaboration that you have,” Alvarez said. “It’s everything we want students to be able to do when they leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron Weddle, director of the Wichita Manufacturing Association, understands that there is still work left to be done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think there are enough kids going into particularly the manufacturing world to meet the needs coming forward,” Weddle said. “They have the basic skill sets, they’re all great with their fingers and their iPads. That’s the factory of the future. We just need to make sure they understand how to use those skill sets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest’s CTE program is moving toward doing just that, which is very important in Carson’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to prepare kids for the next step in life,” Carson said. “We have to get them ready to enter the workforce.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, study, or by being taught. Does that sound familiar? Welcome to the actual definition of learning. Experience, study, being taught&#8211; there is no “memorization to regurgitation” in the definition of learning, so why is that the go-to for our education system? </p>
<p>Students are constantly tested, pulling all nighters, and try to fit into the criteria given to them by their teachers, all in an attempt for the best grade. We follow those motions, the “muscle memory” of students past, but we aren’t actually thinking or learning things to use later in life. We aren’t building up portfolios, we aren’t gaining real life experience, we don’t know how to jump a car, change a tire, or sew a button&#8211; some people don’t know cooking outside of a grilled cheese. These are, of course, “elective courses” we can take throughout our high school career, but that’s the point. Elective courses aren’t important, or at least not seen as such. It doesn’t matter if you can sew your button back on your pants, it just matters if you know the order of the 43 presidents and which one can not tell a lie. </p>
<p>The biggest problem is that teachers aren’t allowed to let us explore our options, they’re not allowed to teach us anything but a paradigm way of thinking, we’re not learning how to truly problem solve. They are not allowed to let us do things that and expand our horizons, but how could they? Our teachers are tested on their ability to teach by standardized tests and we, the students, are tested by our ability to memorize a book, the basics of the essay, and most importantly, how to please the supervisors for the best grade. </p>
<p>The response to this isn’t “that’s how it works. That’s what we do.”, no, the response should always be what’s the problem. We’re told that everything can be changed for the better, that things can always be adjusted to make life better. So why is it that artificial, meaningless-to-real-world tests and grades are the way we think we prepare students? Why is this the way that the self-worth of a student is determined? </p>
<p>College is the biggest ‘jump to’ for schools when defending their current system. Colleges give finals, they say. Students need to be able to pass tests, they claim. The problem with this system isn’t that we haven’t been taking finals, that isn’t why students are having trouble in our universities. </p>
<p>Northwest pushes for AP enrollment, for their students to apply themselves and attempt to take this big test filled with information, or to take concurrent credit, and attempt to gain it before entering college. However, why should we try to do that, when we’ve finally learned how to work the corrupt system?  College courses require you to apply previous knowledge to develop your own theories, they require you to think above your current level of knowledge, and write an essay paper, or to attempt to develop a cure to cancer in the lab. These are things we should be learning to do, these are things we should be required to learn. In high school it’s all about making sure you have a 4.0, an A in every class possible, and are involved enough in school to look good on a college application. We don’t need to know how to apply ourselves, to ask questions for extra knowledge. We just need to know how to pick out the facts from our teachers and apply them to our multiple choice tests. </p>
<p>Our future education is hard, because we don’t know how to think for ourselves. Our ability to function outside of our homes is crippled. We don’t learn, we absorb and memorize. </p>
<p>A busted tire is not fixed by our hands. It’s fixed by a parent, or mechanic, as we calm our hearts on the side of the road. A busted button on pants is not fixed by a quick motion of needle and thread, but instead brought together by a safety pin, and then tossed into the trash. Diabetes is something unsolvable, an enigma with scientific reasoning that can not be cured. It’s not something we think to solve, to try and fix, because we can not see a way to fix it. We do not develop real life experience. We do not develop real life skills. We do not develop critical thinking. </p>
<p>We do not learn how to problem solve. We learn how to write, read, copy, and repeat. We are tested on our ability to spit out facts, to compose a sentence perfectly, and please the administration. </p>
<p>We are asked to write an essay with a paintbrush. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are 24 hours in the day, at least seven required to spend at school, and, according to scientists, nine hours of sleep are required for teenage brains. If you’re in sports, extracurriculars, have a job, or just need to keep up the social aspects of your life, that’d leave you with eight hours to spend on those activities, before you’d be required to cut into your sleep. </p>
<p>For Alyssa Hershey, time can appear crunched at times, and on some days, it’s a matter of choosing.  </p>
<p>Hershey is involved in several things, both in and out of school. Being involved in several shows at Music Theater for Young People (MTYP), Music Theater Wichita (MTW) and Wichita Children’s Theater &#038; dance Center (WTC &#038; DC) on top of school, higher level classes, church, band and even dance classes has lead to her having a jam-packed schedule.  </p>
<p>“It just kinda depends on what’s going on,” Hershey said, “Like how much is going on at that point. Right now, I’m handling it pretty well. A couple weeks ago, though, I was at a breaking point. AP classes, and end of the nine weeks, and being in two shows&#8211; it can just&#8211; it can get really tough.” </p>
<p>The current D and F list policies doesn’t affect Hershey due to her lack of participation in school sports, however her grades and extracurriculars such as: band, symphony, two dance classes, church Wednesday and Sunday, plus three advanced courses, can often lead her to having to make hard decisions and sacrificing things to find that balance. A few weeks back she had several shows and events packed into her short week, and found herself on the edge constantly. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t really sleeping that much, there was a few days in there where I didn’t sleep at all. It was really healthy,” Hershey said, “There were two nights where I pulled two all nighters in a row and I was just always doing something. Right after school I’d be in rehearsals until late and then I’d go straight home and do homework and just eat on the way. Then I’d be up all night doing homework and the next day I’d be doing it all over again. There was a couple times where I almost had a meltdown.”</p>
<p>Although Hershey doesn’t have to worry about not being able to perform if her grades dip down into the lower levels, not all students are as lucky. Business teacher Jeff Darr believes that it’s all a matter of finding a balance, which can be hard with all the things offered at Northwest, and even more so after they added an extra hour a couple years ago. </p>
<p>“There is a point that we need to, as administrators and teachers, I think we need to at least look at the number of classes that we changed two years ago. we went from seven periods to eight periods in terms of classes that students could potentially have projects, homeworks, tests, and things of that nature.” </p>
<p>Principle Alverez believes the D and F list is a good change for Northwest and thinks it should be seen as a positive thing. He wants it to be something to keep students, and teachers aware and seeking help if they need it. </p>
<p>“I think the D and f list was meant to be more of an awareness, not a punishment. The list came about because our athletic teams wanted to have a code of conduct that was tied into the d and f list that tied into the students grades. You had to have several ds and fs before you had your first warning week and after that week if it didn’t come up then there were consequences rather it be no playing time or what not. I think everybody thought that you could only have one D or F but that’s not the case, the case is we’re trying to get students into torturing, in to see their teacher&#8211; We’re trying to make it student friendly and not just a complete punishment.”</p>
<p>Junior Taylor Webber counters. </p>
<p>“Basically it comes down to you can not have a social life, good grades, play a sport, have a job, and get sleep. It’s impossible. How am I supposed to do my homework if I only get two hours of sleep? “</p>
