										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s scary feeling like you’re never going to be happy again. Any spark and any enjoyment you once had is just gone one day. You just wake up and realize you feel different. And when you realize it, you scramble to find it again, something to stimulate you, or any feeling at all.</p>
<p>Depression can make small things big, like lighthearted comment leaving a huge emotional impact, secretly confirming a secret insecurity. Depression can also make big things small, like brushing aside dark thoughts, your brain telling you “You know, they really wouldn’t miss you. You annoy them anyways. If you can’t make yourself happy, why don’t you just do everyone else a favor?”</p>
<p>You lie awake at night, thinking about all the wrongs you may have done unto others, thinking about how you could’ve tried harder to keep everyone happy with you, they all hate you, probably. “You really aren’t worth it, you deserve to be miserable,” is all you can tell youself. “You’ll never be happy again.”</p>
<p>“You’re just being too sensitive. You’re too weak, not strong enough to stay here anymore,” you tell yourself over and over, when your mind should be on other things.</p>
<p>You can’t stop thinking, about what you don’t like about yourself, about how much easier it would be to end it, how grateful everyone would be to you.</p>
<p>You think you’re a waste of space and time, and no, this isn’t the occasional feeling you get when you’re down. This stays for weeks and weeks and that turns into months.</p>
<p>And you’re always, ALWAYS thinking. You can’t stop. Not even to sleep or go to a movie with friends.</p>
<p>Sometimes you take it out on yourself, finding anything that burns or cuts you on the outside, taking it to your skin, over and over, until you’re numb. Anything to give you any form of sensation or release. It becomes hard to feel and be affected by things.</p>
<p>You don’t want to go out anymore. You’re a joke to everyone. Even pain inflicted upon yourself doesn’t let you feel anything.</p>
<p>You get to a point where you don’t want to move. You can’t cry anymore. You’ve given up, you’re so disappointed in yourself. Everybody was always tells you to get over it, but you can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>To yourself, you&#8217;re broken, a freak. Every negative comment and thought has been retained and repeated back, amplified. Everything they say about you must be based in truth, right? You agree with them, anything they say to you.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just, uncomfortable, being yourself, feeling how you&#8217;re feeling. You feel crazy. You cry out of the frustration just a normal day give you. You’re just so frustrated that you just can’t be happy. You can’t stand yourself. You have no right to be this unhappy.</p>
<p>But the reality of it is, you physically can’t help it.</p>
<p>Depression is a disease, not an emotion. Many people don’t realize its severity until its too late, and even then, many are left with questions.</p>
<p>A person is not selfish for being affected by depression, or losing to it. To take your own life takes a lot of thought about everyone in your life, and is not selfish. It isn’t selfish to reach out either, everybody deserves help.</p>
<p>Depression, despite common belief, is not just being sad, or having a bad day. It is based in the chemistry of the brain, physically hindering a person&#8217;s happiness.</p>
<p>Telling someone “it’s all in your head” isn’t going to make it any better or any easier, it won’t magically cure a person if all you say is “cheer up.”</p>
<p>If somebody tells you they&#8217;re feeling anything even close to this, GET THEM HELP.</p>
<p>If you feel anything similar to this, GET HELP.</p>
<p>It can be helped, no matter how terrible you feel, you can hang on a little longer.</p>
<p>You deserve to feel happy again, and just as you began to feel depressed, you can begin to recover as well.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re stronger than you think you are, you can be helped.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Depression is a mental disorder which leaves a person feeling unsatisfied, despondent, and sad for long periods of time. According to the Mayo Clinic, depression can be caused by a physical or chemical imbalance in the brain, as well as genetics and emotional trauma. All of these out of a person’s control.</p>
<p>Depression is never the fault of those affected, it is not something they choose. Depression is also extremely common among teens and young adults and those who abuse substances. Also those who suffer from clinical anxiety, (no not being worried before a test, but REAL anxiety,) as the two mental illnesses often go hand in hand with one another.</p>
<p>And just as depression can stem from anxiety, it can go the other way. Some of the more common results of depression include anxiety as well as weight change, difficulty in school, work, and social isolation.</p>
<p>In more extreme and untreated cases of depression, some turn towards substance abuse and other forms of self mutilation. This is used as a form of escape for some people, a sort of release. For some it’s the only thing they can feel.</p>
<p>Some common warning signs for depression include (from the Mayo Clinic):</p>
<ul>
<li>Feelings of sadness, emptiness or unhappiness</li>
<li>Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters</li>
<li>Loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, such as sex</li>
<li>Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much</li>
<li>Tiredness and lack of energy, so that even small tasks take extra effort</li>
<li>Changes in appetite — often reduced appetite and weight loss, but increased cravings for food and weight gain in some people</li>
<li>Anxiety, agitation or restlessness — for example, excessive worrying, pacing, hand-wringing or an inability to sit still</li>
<li>Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements</li>
<li>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or blaming yourself for things that are not your responsibility</li>
<li>Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things</li>
<li>Frequent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide</li>
<li>Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also several types of depression, such as seasonal depression, and anxious distress depression. Some types of depression can be accompanied with things ranging from hallucinations to involuntary movements.</p>
<p>If you experience any of the above symptoms, get immediate help. Set up an appointment with your family doctor to be referred to a therapist. Even talking to the school counselor is a good start.</p>
<p>If you feel you may have depression, take note of your symptoms for reference during your first visit. Also take into account familial history, your current situation, any events that may have triggered this, and even a medicine you started. All could be a legitimate cause of depression.</p>
<p>Seek immediate attention if you feel suicidal, or even begin to contemplate suicide. Call an emergency hotline or find another form of emergency service.</p>
<p>Depression can be worked through gradually with persistence, it is hard, but always worth it.</p>
<p>Listen to your doctor, take notes, be actively involved in resolving your depression. It is extremely difficult, but having a good support system behind you is always a good idea.</p>
<p>Treatments can include medication (like with any other disease,) and therapy, or a mixture of both.</p>
<p>If your friend or someone you know shows these symptoms, seek help for them. Talk to them. And most importantly; listen to them. Don’t just tell them to cheer up or put their mind on other things, as this does nothing to help. Do not blame them. Be supportive and recognize their problems, and offer to help them work through their depression.</p>
<p>Depression does not have to be faced alone. The suicide hotline can be found at 1-800-273-TALK, and crisistextline.org can also be helpful.</p>
