										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do you or anyone you know have trouble sleeping? If so, there&#8217;s a possible solution you should try.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since school has started, summer has ended, and everything is almost back to normal, sleeping schedules have changed quickly. It&#8217;s not unusual for teens to sleep late and wake up even later. Students have gotten out of the habit of going to bed early because they didn&#8217;t have to wake up as early last year. Because of that, many students have developed sleeping issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A great solution to this problem is melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that is released by the pineal gland at night time. It has been proven to to work with your sleeping cycle and train your mind to a sleeping schedule. Many people can lack melatonin in their system so now it can actually be taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ways to take melatonin can be pills or gummies. Gummies are more popular with kids and teens. The melatonin is infused into the gummies and pills. There are two types of melatonin, synthetic which is manmade, and natural which is made from animals pineal gland just like humans have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Depending on how much a person takes it could take some time to kick it but when it does you&#8217;ll feel it and eventually fall asleep. The more common amount of time it takes is 30 minutes. This is a great way to fall back into a healthy sleeping schedule.&nbsp;</p>
