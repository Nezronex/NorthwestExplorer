<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What got you interested in anime?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “My sister started reading a lot of the comic books when we were younger and then eventually I started reading some of those. I had, technically, been watching anime since I was a really little kid; I didn’t know it was anything different. Through different friends and family, it was just kind of a thing we watched and then when I was in my tweens and teen years then I just discovered ‘oh my gosh this is a big thing!’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What got you interested in cosplaying?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: “I’ve been coming to anime fest in Wichita for seven years now. And I&#8217;ve actually been making costumes and sewing since I was 6 and 7. I’ve actually been making costumes way before I had my realization about anime, but when I found out that I can have both of them together I just started sewing costumes and eventually I started competing in competitions.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: Have you been to other conventions other than the one in Wichita?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “I’ve been to ton of cons in the US. Not lots of big ones but I&#8217;ve started to expand a bit more.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What inspired your costume?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “I actually made every single piece of this. I pattered all of these &nbsp;[pieces of] clothing by myself. I do not use any store bought patterns. I do all of the sizing from scratch and, this whole prop and everything, I built myself.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This actually has a manga and an anime, its actually quite old. It’s called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardcaptor Sakura</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it’s one of the original, magical girl series. It’s kind of around the same age as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;.Kind of like in the 90s.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What&#8217;s your favorite anime? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>A:&nbsp;“I don’t think I have a specific favorite show. As far as certain movies, genres, and series that I like, I like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio Ghibli </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movies. Those were one of the first things I watched when I was a kid and they were amazing&#8230;.they’re some of the best parts of my childhood. They’re such inspirational, sweet, adventurous movies. It’s always amazing.” </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her costume took her nine hours and three evenings to make. Most of her costumes take longer than that, but this specific costume (as shown in the photo) was one of her most simple ones. She has multiple versions of the same character, therefore reusing the same wig and prop. </span></li>

I just come, mainly, to see all my friends that I, honestly, have through cosplay and whatnot. I just come to hang out and everything. I haven&#8217;t been doing any cosplay here in the last couple of years just because I&#8217;ve been working on other stuff. I used to be pretty big into it.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Have you been to other conventions other than the one in Wichita? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>A:&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Naka-kon, Nep-con up in Nebraska which I&#8217;ve also been to quite often.
