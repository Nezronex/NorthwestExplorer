										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The library is now offering a blind dating service. A blind date with a book, that is.</p>
<p>To try to encourage reading, certain books are now being concealed in Valentine’s day themed wrapping paper, waiting to be picked up. Students are then encouraged to pick up one of the “mystery” novels, take it to the checkout counter, then unwrap it to discover what book they are having a “blind date” with. </p>
<p>The rules are simple: read at least 30 pages. When you finish, come back and rate your book on a scale from “horrible” to “amazing.”  </p>
<p>“I really want to try it. It sounds really cool,” says freshman McKayla Siemiller. </p>
<p>The hope is that the draw of the unknown will tempt more kids to read.</p>
<p>“Books are important because they are real people’s stories, and you get to experience and understand another world, another person’s feelings and experiences. Reading makes us better people,” says Lizanne Minerva.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In the Northwest library, students were allowed to donate canned goods to pay for their library fines. Librarians Rinann Speaker and Kim Isherwood decided to start the donation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We figured since there was so much going on in December with donations and people are donated out between Thanksgiving and Christmas that we would wait and do it in February around Valentines Day.” Speaker said</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many students donated food to pay for library fines anywhere from $3 to $25.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We want our books back. We want people to read them and to bring them back. It’s nice to get fines, to buy more books. But really we want our materials back.” Speaker said</p>
<p dir="ltr">The canned goods were donated to the Kansas Food Bank. One item could be worth up to $3. Some students brought in a lot of cans to pay for expensive fines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When we sent out notices for late books. There were 600 notices.” Speaker Said</p>
<p>Students were allowed to bring in canned good the week before spring break began. Many students brought in canned goods and returned their late books. After donating all the canned goods, and getting their materials back, the librarians were happy to check out books to students that couldn’t because of their fines.</p>
