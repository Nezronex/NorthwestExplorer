<p dir="ltr">The Northwest girls won their first game 53-33 against North on Dec. 6, and demolished West in their second game  with a 67-21 score on Dec. 10.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s always a great experience,” sophomore Shaunece Grant said on her first year playing with the varsity team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The girls have started off great so far and are improving in their practices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So far as a team we have gotten better each game, so I hope that continues,” Grant said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve been turning the ball over a lot so we have been focusing on keeping the ball in practice, I think our hard work will pay off in our next game against South,” sophomore Haley Cooper said.</p>
<p>Their next game is on Tuesday, Dec. 17 at home against South.</p>
