										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Auditions for the North/Northwest collaboration of “Grease” were held in the Northwest auditorium on Aug. 21 and 22.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be a cool project,” North drama teacher Tyrone Galbreath said. “Lundin and I have been friends for a while so we thought we’d try this out and I think it’ll be kind of cool to bring two schools together and work on a project.”</p>
<p>Over 100 kids auditioned in the two day period.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>“Auditions are taking a little longer than I wanted but that’s really a good thing,” Northwest drama teacher Richard Lundin said. “That means that lots of kids are showing up.”</p>
