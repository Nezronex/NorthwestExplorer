										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Northwest students joined several other teams from Wichita Public schools to compete in a cooking competition on Jan. 27 at South High. </p>
<p>Junior Autumn O’Conner and senior Marcus Wooley decided to step up after their culinary class was prompted for the competition. The goal? Create a delicious, nutritious school lunch for the enjoyment of their peers. </p>
<p>“We had made enchiladas and our fruit and a vegetable side dish,” O’Conner said, “The fruit had kiwi, oranges, cinnamon, and granola mixed into it. Our vegetable dish was a bean cilantro. Mostly everyone liked it, but we didn’t come in first place.” </p>
<p>The students had to have some food purchased for them and provided with pre-cooked hamburger meat before their meal was prepared and presented before a group of judges. The winners of this competition would receive a paid trip to Washington D.C. and have their food  incorporated into the school food. </p>
<p>“Our next competition will be with the whole entire state,” O’Conner said, “We’ll be going to a hotel, and we designed our own restaurant that’s called the Royal Soul Food and it has a bakery in it.”<br />
According to culinary instructor Alison Draut, O’Conner, Wooley, sophomore Cheyanne Sanders, and junior Haleigh Lovings will be participating in two competitions: management and edible garnish. For the management competition, students will be presenting a restaurant before a panel of judges which can range from business owners to chefs from universities. The edible garnish competition will have students sculpting things like dinosaurs, or flowers, from fruit.  </p>
<p>“I’m preparing by taking it on as if I was really opening one [a restaurant],” Wooley said, “so I called all the places and I’m so, ready. I can’t even explain how ready I am for this.” </p>
<p>The two will participate March 3 and 4 with students from all over the state of Kansas. </p>
<p>“It’s not all about winning,” O’Conner said, “that was a small competition this one this one is going to be a whole lot bigger and we want to show our school.”</p>
