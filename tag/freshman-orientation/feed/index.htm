										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright and early Monday morning, August 14, 2023, Northwest High school welcomed our freshmen. There were 367 freshmen students who were navigating the halls, learning about the school’s culture and schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first week of school is different for everyone- freshmen are transitioning and rushing around trying to figure out the hallway system and how to be a high school student. Freshman Casey Stuart said the beginning of the year was an adjustment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was cool, kind of a bit boring. Awkward, though, because no one wanted to talk in class,” Stuart said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ike Childs said Northwest was better than his previous school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was pretty good, a lot calmer. Not as many fights surprisingly,” Childs said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One big difference, the freshmen have noticed, between high school and middle school is block scheduling and time difference. Here at Northwest, class periods are 80 minutes long, which some students were finding hard to get used to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“..classes aren’t too hard. Just longer periods and that’s annoying,” Childs said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change from middle school is lunch organization, everyone going at the same time. A benefit that seemed popular is being able to hang out with different grades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like being able to hang out with upperclassmen since there’s not many cool freshmen,” Childs said.</span></p>
