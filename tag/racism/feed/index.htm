										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard someone (white) say; “You aren’t (insert race here,) you’re just a person to me! I don’t see race!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I can’t help but cringe when I hear that, not because I don’t think they’re a person, but because I do see their race.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Society has developed a way to circumvent races through eliminating POC from their color spectrum, and just pretending to see white.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I know it isn’t supposed to be meant that way, but the habit of thinking is definitely not a step forward.</p>
<p>Whenever someone tells me they’re racially colorblind, what they’re really telling me is that they’ve been told to not judge others by the color of their skin so much that they’ve completely minimized that aspect of a human being’s identity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Different cultures deserve representation in society, a persons skin is still a part of them and shouldn’t be an uncomfortable topic because it’s different than the usual mix of European countries.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s the point most people miss because they try to ignore skin color.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My mother is often mistaken for a multitude of races, and her dad was an immigrant from an unknown country so she identifies as white, but a lot of people just make assumptions because they’re afraid to ask, usually lying somewhere in Mexico when the truth is far more interesting and unique to her.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve never met someone who didn’t have something interesting to tell me about where their roots lie, most were glad I actually ask questions rather than skirt around an important part of them.</p>
