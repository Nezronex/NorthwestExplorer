										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pie Five is a pizzeria located on S. Ridge Rd, next to Lowes and Applebees; and I have to say that I was fairly impressed. The walk in was extremely similar to Chipotle’s, and the wait was just as long. Walking in, there is a long walkway towards the left and forward to the order area. i felt relaxed, the opposite feeling you get at a sports bar. I could relax, and have quiet conversation with my friend.  </p>
<p>Seating was like your typical Chipotle setup, but with more crimson, grey and white opposed to Chipotle’s maroon and brick red. The cool, calm environment gave me the opportunity to focus on my food and friend.</p>
<p>At the counter, you select how you want your pizza. From all the cheeses, different meat and vegetables toppings; the true definition of personal panned. Contrast to the stereotypical pizza, the crust here was quite doughy. The meat on it was crafted to crispiness, and the cheese melted into the sauce like ice cream in the summer. The pizza was so life changing, I had an epiphany every bite. I’d rate the pizzeria at a 4 out of 5 stars, based off of the pizza service, and restaurant comfortability. I’d definitely recommend it for anyone searching for that “next level” of pizza. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">After coming back from Christmas vacation after languishing on a silky beach in Puerto Rico or getting some fresh air upon a mountain top, Kansas seems rather dull.  Here is a short list reminding everyone why there is no place like home.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">1.     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6DJcgm3wNY">We have Superman.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Clark Kent may not be real, but Kansas takes the spotlight whenever the Man of Steel pops up in comics, movies, or TV. The DC comic character was raised in the small Kansas town of Smallville, which means that Kansas has dibs on one of the most famous superheroes of all time.  I don’t know about anyone else, but my family knuckle-bumped when Superman told the general that, “I was raised in Kansas. I’m about as American as it gets,” in the new movie.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2.     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU">Oz</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike other states that have issues with tornadoes, our tornadoes throw people into worlds with munchkins and pretty red shoes. Frank L Baum’s novel is about a Kansas girl named Dorothy who travels through the land of Oz with her dog, Toto in order to find the Wizard.  Nominated for six Academy awards, The Wizard of Oz is one of the most popular American movies to date.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3.     <a href="https://twitter.com/pizzahut">Pizza Hut</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Not only did Pizza Hut originate in Kansas, it came from Wichita, making it extra special. Despite efforts to make sure this does not become an ad&#8230;Pizza hut is the best pizza ever. Those who disagree clearly have never attended a sleepover where your so-called friends dare you to drink something so bad you don’t think you will ever be able to taste anything again and then you bite into an absolutely gorgeous piece of Canadian bacon&#8230;bliss. Pizza hut is not the only business to originate in Wichita and do well. Taco Tico, White Castle, and Freddy’s are other Wichita restaurant alumni.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4.     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLoICzrsi7c">Dennis the Menace</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have ever picked up a newspaper&#8230;ever..you have probably met the lovable mischievous boy that is the namesake of the comic strip that was the basis for several TV series and  movies. However, you may not have known that Dennis the Menace is supposed to live in Wichita Kansas. To be precise, he lives on 2251 Pine Road.  Fun act: For a while, Dennis the Menace was DQ’s mascot. He is just that awesome.</p>
<p dir="ltr">5.     <a href="https://www.scz.org">Sedgwick County Zoo</a></p>
<p>Without trying to brag, we have one of the best zoos in the country.  The Sedgwick Country Zoo is ranked nationally, participates in multiple breeding programs, and just keeps getting better. Over 400 species of animals including red pandas, tigers and penguins  call the zoo home. Currently, it is ranked as Kansas’s number one outdoor family destination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Uncle Joe’s Pizzeria recently opened across the street from Northwest High School, where Talliano’s Pizzeria was previously located.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like any other average teenagers, a friend and I were hungry after school, so we decided to go try this new place out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Walking into the pizzeria shortly after school, we saw that it was very, very slow&#8230; But it is still very new, so not many people have heard much about it. Being the only people in the pizzeria at this time, though, we got to talk to the owner a little bit about the restaurant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The owner asked if we were students from Northwest, and, of course, we told him yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">He asked what time our lunches start. “First lunch starts at 10:47 and second lunch starts at 12:14,” we told him. He said he thought it was pretty early, but was considering opening up the pizzeria around 10:30 instead of 11:00 so students could venture across the street for some pizza for lunch. He was always ready to open at that time anyway. Since the pizzeria is still fairly new, it would be a good start to getting a little more business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for the food?</p>
<p>There is a salad bar, pizza buffet, pasta, calzones, anything you’d expect to see at a pizza place. They’ll even ask you if you have any special requests for pizzas for the buffet! I personally think the pizza is great, but the customer service could use some work. To the girl that took my order, please try not to look so mad next time.</p>
