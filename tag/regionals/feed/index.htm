										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Grizzly football team is 5-4 going into Regionals. Friday’s game is against Garden City in the District play-offs. “We have to play our best game because it’s the only game we are guaranteed,” head coach Steve Martin said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the season almost over, the team is going to have to keep their heads in the game and practice hard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I expect us to be incredibly focused. Garden is a great team and we will have to play well. They have fought so hard this year to be in this position,” Martin said.</p>
<p>The team will play Garden City on Friday Nov. 8 at 7 p.m.. If Northwest prevails, they will either play Topeka at home or Heights away. “I am extremely happy with the way they have fought and worked this year. I hope to have a couple more weeks with them,” Martin said.</p>
