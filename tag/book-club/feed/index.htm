										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The last book club meeting found the members eating snacks, playing games and discussing Divergent. This month they met again to discuss The Help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Help is a book set in the 1960’s about a group of black maids working in Jackson, Miss.  A young writer wants to tell their story and finds out about who these women are and what they do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In celebration of the book, the club ate some tasty chocolate cake, discussed the book and watched the award-winning movie adaption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new book for this month is entitled “All the Truth That’s in Me” by Julie Berry. Taking place in an unnamed historical setting, the award-winning novel tells the story of a girl who cannot talk after having part of her tongue cut out by her captor of two years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Northwest book club recently had its second meeting to discuss the next three months and to hold elections for officers. A T-shirt design was also proposed and approved along with a possible trip to see The City of Bones, the movie based off the first book in the Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The book club also discussed last month’s book, The Reluctant Assassin. Most of the club agreed with each other on their feelings about the book: they liked the characters and they liked the book- after it actually started moving.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After discussions about the book ended, the next topic was the books for the next three months. October’s book is Austenland by Shannon Hale, a novel about a woman obsessed with Jane Austen, who goes to a place where people stay and pretend to participate in a world that imitates a Jane Austen novel. November’s book will be the dystopian novel Divergent by Veronica Roth  about a society who divides you up based on your values. December’s book will be The Help by Kathryn Stockett about a group of black maids working in white households in Mississippi during the 1960’s. All three have been or will be made into movies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Five officers ran to be picked for a form of office. Eventually, Emma Bennet was elected President, with four other members filling in the spots of vice president,  secretary, treasurer and historian.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The T-shirt design chosen will feature a stack of book and carry the slogan “Just one more chapter…Well maybe the rest of the book.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Future books that are up to be chosen for future months are The Maze Runner by James Dashner, Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand, Born of Illusion by Teri Brown, and A Tale Dark and Grimm by Adam Gidwitz. Other suggestions will be added when the book club holds its next meeting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Austenland Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbHr8YyjSlg"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbHr8YyjSlg</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Divergent Trailer:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6HHCxLZftQ"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6HHCxLZftQ</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Help Trailer:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbuKgzgeUIU"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbuKgzgeUIU</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Northwest book club met on Sept. 3, to pick a book they wanted to read and discuss and to pick a movie they wanted to see.</p>
<p>By the time the meeting ended at four, Eoin Colfer’s The Reluctant Assassin was picked, and the movie selected was City of Bones, the movie based off the novel by Cassandra Clare.</p>
<p>“This is going to be a lot better than last year,” said Junior Katherin Kitchen.</p>
<p>Some of the other books thrown out for consideration (and that might be picked in the future) included Divergent, The Help, Born of Illusion and Unbroken.</p>
<p>It was mentioned the book club was hoping to possibly grow this year, with one member jokingly stating that, “We are not reading girly books. Please show up.”</p>
<p>For people looking for opportunities in the Language Arts department, joining book club might be smart move-some teachers are letting the current book club book be read as an IRP book.</p>
<p>The next book club meeting takes place on Oct 1 in B22 to discuss their current novel, and find different activities to do with the books they read.</p>
