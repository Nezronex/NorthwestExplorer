										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest’s wrestling team has been accomplishing all they set out for so far this season. The team is 5-0 in the City League. “We have eight kids ranked for state already, so I’d say that we’re doing well,” wrestling coach Eric Prichard said. The team has won every tournament they have been to so far including Wellington, Pratt, and Bishop Carrol. “The team is right where I want them to be right now,” Prichard said. Northwest is going for their 3rd straight City League championship. “I really want us to go for a three-peat, I don’t think its been done before yet,” Prichard said. The wrestlers most recently had a 49-18 win against Heights on Wednesday, Jan. 29. “I’m looking forward to finishing the year strong, and really hoping for a top three finish at state this year,” Prichard said.</p>
