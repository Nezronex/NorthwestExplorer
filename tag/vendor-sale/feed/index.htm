										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drama department will be having a Vendor Sale this Saturday, it will take place from 9am to 3pm in the commons.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is being organized by Vickie Nevins through Wichita All Biz as a fund raiser for the Drama Department,&#8221; said Drama teacher Richard Lundin. &#8220;Drama students and volunteers from the Performing Arts Booster Club will be participating as helpers to keep the event moving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vendors pay to have a booth to sell their items.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the third vendor’s fair to occur at Northwest this year,&#8221; said Lundin. &#8220;Exactly which vendors will be there is uncertain.  The last count had 105 businesses who had responded to the invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course factors such as weather impact who will show up in the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be local authors doing book signings, food trucks, a Zumba demonstration, and much more,&#8221; said Lundin.</p>
<p>This is their first time trying an event like this.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; we are still not 100% sure of what to expect,&#8221; said Lundin. &#8220;We are very excited but a little nervous at the same time.&#8221;</p>
