										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Drugs have become such a regular part of society, it seems nobody blinks an eye when someone smokes pot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It seems like a popular thing to do and it comes down to a lot of peer pressure,” says sophomore Andrew Minter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students all throughout Northwest smoke pot everyday without anyone even suspecting it. The NCSA states about 17 percent of high school students drink, smoke or use drugs during the school day, and nearly 44 percent of students told survey-takers they know a classmate who sells drugs. Nearly 69 million Americans over the age of 12 have tried marijuana at least once, so it isn’t surprising that when students were asked if they knew anyone who had used, the answer was rarely no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t know anyone specifically,” says one anonymous source, “but I bet I know a lot of people who have (smoked weed.)”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But why is it such a common drug among high school students and, what makes it such a popular choice among young people?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to dregfreeworld.org side effects of pot include “Loss of coordination and distortions in the sense of time, vision and hearing, sleepiness, reddening of the eyes, increased appetite and relaxed muscles.” Heart risks are also a factor. Within the first hour the user’s risk of a heart attack could increase fivefold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“People just like it, I guess, it relaxes them and makes them feel better,” says another anonymous source. “They just smoke it for fun, or just to see what it’s like.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its popularity may also be due to its availability, Marijuana possession arrests accounted for 90% of all marijuana arrests in KS during 2007. The popularity also adds to its supply and demand effect.</p>
<p>But the general opinion on the threat it holds is well stated by anonymous: “I don’t care if other people do it but I wouldn’t do it myself.”</p>
