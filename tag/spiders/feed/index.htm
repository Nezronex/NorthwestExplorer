										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I looked in the mirror and was mortified.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I returned home from the KSPA Conference in Lawrence, I wanted nothing more than a cold shower to end my long day, which started at around 4:40 a.m.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But while admiring my reflection before I stepped in my refreshing shower, I was faced with something not so refreshing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A monstrous growth was on my shoulder blade, almost resembling a mosquito bite in coloration but maybe quadruple the size.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I showed it to my mom and she said it looked like a spider bite, but I thought little of it. I jokingly tried to tap into my spidey senses, scale walls, shoot webs from my palms&#8230; All of my attempts were unsuccessful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The next morning, I woke up with a 101.7º (F) fever. I was feeling nauseated and as I headed to the bathroom, I nearly collapsed due to dizziness. Soon enough, the swelling at the site of the bite reached from my shoulder to my waist on the whole right side of my back. Abdominal pain, headaches and shortness of breath ensued. No Spiderman capabilities yet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We went to the doctor and he told me I might have appendicitis, but I received no treatment whatsoever.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Within the next couple days, I was covered nearly from head to toe from a burning, itchy red rash. So on a second trip to the doctor, he acknowledged that I was bitten by a bug- he refused to recognize that it was a brown recluse- and I took a steroid shot and received antibiotics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since then, all of my symptoms except for a little soreness have subsided. Nonetheless, the “core” of the bite did fall out, leaving a hole in my back that you could literally stick your finger into. Luckily, skin is already growing back over it- some people undergo a much slower healing process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moral of the story? Don’t get bitten by a brown recluse. But if you do, don’t let your doctor tell you have appendicitis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spider bites are not limited to the appearance and the symptoms I described. If you experience any of the ones I listed, however, seek medical attention. The treatment really helped alleviate my discomfort.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">As winter approaches, the world outside changes, trees lose all their leaves, families prepare for the holidays and spiders find residence in your basement.  Yes, spiders, mostly the brown recluse and the notorious black widow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When the weather gets cold and rainy these spiders will often move inside to avoid the conditions outside.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here is some information about each of these types of spiders:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Brown Recluse</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Lives in the southeastern United States</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bite contains a hemotoxin, a poison that makes the skin around the bite corrode away.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Brown Recluse usually only bites when pressed up against the skin, so many people don’t get bitten even though they live in houses containing them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They live in damp and dark undisturbed areas, such as basements or closets.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Black Widow</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Named this because female has been known to kill the male after mating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Easily identified because of its black tint with a red hourglass shape on its abdomen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The black widow creates a messy, unorganized web, usually found in the same conditions as the brown recluse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bite can cause death, but only if it’s not treated within a few hours using an anti-venom.</p>
