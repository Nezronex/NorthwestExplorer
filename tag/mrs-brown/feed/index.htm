										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">She never imagined she’d be teaching. She thought she would become a professional singer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“My dream was to travel and be in music theatre,” said choir teacher Amy Brown.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Brown studied at Arizona State University for her major in music theatre, she was involved in a total of 25 shows. In pursuing her dream in music theatre, she got pregnant and decided it was time to stop performing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Never wanting to give up on her passion for music, she chose to start teaching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She enjoys teaching because teaching to her is like “parts of a team to make a goal.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">During her time at Arizona, she stumbled upon a man who she would later call her husband.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Needless to say, they fell in love, got married, and had kids. At this point Brown realized she should probably settle down and stop performing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown was relentless to quit music theatre all together and made a decision to begin teaching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown substituted at Wichita State University in 2000 for a while, and then moved on to a more official teaching job at Wilbur Middle School. Brown taught at Wilbur for 6 years and enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ve always loved seeing people grow and change,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After working at Wilbur for quite some time, Brown was offered a job as the choir teacher for Northwest High School; she accepted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No matter what life threw at her, she could never drift from her musical habits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So here she is now, her tenth year teaching for USD 259, inspiring her kids everyday and being inspired herself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There’s this amazing thing where people think they can’t do it, then you work with them and they do it,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown loves teaching at Northwest and is always looking for ways to make each choir just a little bit better.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We can do stuff at a professional level,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though teaching wasn’t her original plan, Brown doesn’t regret her decision.</p>
<p>“Seeing that kid who never thought they could do it, do it. It’s addictive,” Brown said.</p>
