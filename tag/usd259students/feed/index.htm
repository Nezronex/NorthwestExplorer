										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Rangel, a 17-year old Juinor from Northwest high school whose weekdays are filled with school homework, working on projects, and completing them before the deadlines hit. He is persistent when it comes to keeping his grades up and making sure he has time in his schedule to keep up with his passions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rangel explains that he doesn&#8217;t stand out in a crowd although recently he dyed his hair pink which is contrasting to his statement in which he felt that he normally doesn’t stand out. Rangel has a passion for painting and other forms of art. He picked up this passion from gaining lots of free time after his mom would not let him go outsideWeekends are filled with drawing, painting, and sewing time. Those are activities that keep him relaxed and mellowed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just became something I always loved to do and I&#8217;m still learning new ways to draw forms and shade along with finding different mediums to paint with,” Rangel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sewing is something he picked up not too long ago and it’s something that he isn’t the best at but is something that he feels passionate about. Rangel plans to continue learning new patterns and stitches. Learning how to find a steadying pattern and making himself a shirt that doesn’t fall apart at the seams is a goal he has. Activities, passions, and goals are things that keep Rangel going to help motivate him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My parents have always been impressed by my finished projects and think I can really make something out of them, they always take me out when they can if I&#8217;m in need of more supplies. ” Rangel said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the stress students have on them when it comes to finals, holding finals back until January just overall seems unfair. I think it’s cool that we as students are getting the chance to have a break from school, but it seems more logical to give us finals than send us on break. It doesn’t seem logical though to send us on break, then test us over everything we have learned over the semester. Most kids use their break to relax, so giving them tests when they get back from break may cause them to lose some knowledge making it to where the student body is overall more stressed out and mental health gets worse because of all the stress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting until January to take finals prolongs the semester’s stress that weighs on students. High school is meant to prepare students for the academic challenges they&#8217;ll face once they go on to college. For many teens, however, going the distance is a struggle. Students tend to get more stressed around finals because they have a mental barrier telling them they can’t do it. This commonly leads to them dropping out or letting their mental health get so bad and not reaching out for health and end up doing something like offing themselves which is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. The reasons that students end up dropping out vary–for some, it&#8217;s just a matter of poor attendance while others have to find work to support their family, it can also be common that stress is the reason why students end up dropping out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end of the semester is always a relief for students, and holding finals back delays that relief that students usually enjoy before the holidays. That refreshing moment when you have all your schoolwork done and it seems like you’re off the hook and you don’t have anything to worry about and that you’re ahead is the best feeling in the world. With a blink of an eye that feeling can go away and that stress you had before immediately comes back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking finals now, in December before the break would put a lot of stress on the students now, but giving finals after the break has the potential to send kids into overload. Some may feel unprepared because they’re been away from school for two weeks and information has been lost. Students may feel like there is nobody to reach out to because online schooling has left people feeling helpless for the main fact that we are all so distanced from each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school system is pushing so much information into our brains and it can truly be overwhelming. Reaching out to teachers tends to be difficult nowadays because they are bombarded with emails from stressed-out, overworked teenagers who just trying to get some help. Since students get so much school work their social time gets cut out and they lose some parts of themselves, this could have a serious impact on the mental health of not only the students but the people around them too. Every student may be in a different situation, some may be dealing with mental health; on the other hand, some may be dealing with family issues. The school system has been known from personal experiences and just as a generalized statement to push work down students’ throats making it to where they tend to be so overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;That saying, it’s unfair to students when they have to wait till January to take their finals because winter break is supposed to be there to relax but waiting to take finals may weigh on some leading them to not be able to relax. The school system is putting a lot of pressure on its students. It&#8217;s really unfair, young people shouldn&#8217;t have to be put through this much stress. I understand that it&#8217;s to &#8220;prepare us for adulthood&#8221; but a lot of stress is being placed on some that might not be ready for it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FCCLA has a national membership of over 175,000 young men and women. There are 53 state associations including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, etc. FCCLA was founded in 1945, FCCLA has involved over nine million youth. This year Sara Abrahams had made an official group for Northwest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FCCLA group participates in community service activities, last week they did an operation holiday and last year They did competitions for things. Some of their activities include personal finances, consumer rights, and responsibilities, technology, health, and safety,&nbsp; environment, and FCCLA knowledge. With COVID, all of the competitions are online this year so they are not participating in them. Anyone at Northwest has the ability to join this after school group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s shown to be more beneficial to have joined if you have FAC classes (family and consumer sciences)classes that you have taken but it’s not required. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community service is apart of the class for this program but no background checks happen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since COVID had a set-back for many students and activities the FCCLA group meets once a week after school on teams. Being in-person makes it to where there are more opportunities for students to be able to do the activities available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara Abraham is the leader of the after school program, and Jesse Hancock is the President of the program led at Northwest. Right now there are a total of eight students that are in the group. This group is also available for students of all grade levels to join.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group usually meets around 2:45 P.M. making it to where you are able to join during their advocacy hour. During the time they meet, the group discusses what they are able to do around the community. This consists of things like picking up trash, operation holiday, etc. Sara Abraham explained that since things are mostly online it has been more difficult to do activities, she also explained that most community service project that is done in larger groups have been put to a halt because of the social distancing matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fcclainc.org is the official website for the program that Sara Abraham and a couple of other students are participating in. Students who are in the after-school program have the ability to earn scholarships by the end of their senior year. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into the school year and finding out that you’re not able to go back in person can be frustrating to some, relieving to others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the original plan was for secondary students to return to school for the second nine weeks, the school board reversed that because of rising Covid-19 rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This information has felt like bad luck for some simply because, missing out on the high school experience could be disappointing for most. Especially because people talk about the high school experience being out there and life-changing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m just waiting for the day that they say we can go back to school because that will make me feel better,” Daysha Ogunbiyi, senior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogunbiyi expressed that she feels like online school is something that everyone needs to get used to. Ogunbiyi explained that as a senior this is not how she wanted to spend her last year in high school. Ogunbiyi said that she and her fellow classmates are just waiting on the day students are allowed to go back in person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also explained that because she’s a senior she’s missing out on last dances, no first day of senior year, making new friends, visiting colleges, talking to the guidance counselors, and just having the overall high school experience for one last time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing motivation is something that can happen when you have high expectations; staying on task when at home can be extremely stressful or disruptive depending on what environment someone is in. It’s common to be able to not learn very quickly or effectively on the laptops this year because it’s still semi all-new, Ogunbiyi said when explaining that she had an easier time losing motivation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something that isn’t so good about online learning for students’ mental health is definitely the new socialization rules or ways of socializing” freshman Kylie Olsen, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olsen said that she has heard from other students that remote schooling has a positive effect on students’ organization skills, but she has not had as much trouble with the organization as most people. Olsen said that if there was a chance where she could go back and it would be safe for everyone she would take the offer. Olsen said she believes that being in person when at school is better for her because she thinks that staying focused is less challenging. Online school may not be the most ideal citation for some but for others, it may seem to work better making it to where their motivation goes up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think online school is going well so far; It’s not ideal but we are making the best out of a bad situation.” Emmarie Nickel, Senior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickel explained in an online interview that she understands that safety is what is important, regardless of if it’s what people like or not. Nickel also said she understands the importance of getting the high school experience and getting to do activities, but in an instance where people have a chance of getting sick, it’s best to keep safe and not go out and have fun. She said missing the social aspect of the school is something that crosses her mind quite often, but regardless of this, she would continue to stay online because it’s safe and she can enjoy the comfort of her own bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olsen explained that although it is challenging to do some of the activities people might have been looking forward to this year. It is also in the best interest of the people to stay online for schooling because it lowers the likelihood of more people getting sick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Education is our passport to the future, it takes us to success and makes the people in this world life changers for some” Olsen, Freshmen.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes a “good” teacher, or principal, or as a general statement someone who calls the shots is an open question. Some would consider a good authorizer one who doesn’t give much work while others would tend to consider one a good authorizer if they had them on their feet 24/7 and always had work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hard work makes anybody a great candidate for any profession. When a teacher works hard to get you quality material that makes them a good teacher,” freshman Mia More said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More said she believes that the main thing that makes a good teacher is their attitude and their push for motivation.&nbsp; While some new teachers,&nbsp; may tend to struggle with this, most are able to take the time to get to know their students well enough to understand what kind of workload the students can handle. However, when a teacher takes that extra mile to make sure you understand the material, that makes them outstanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A teacher that is willing to adapt to modern-day, even if they have been there for 20 years, shows that they’re willing to make the change for the better well being of the students,” freshman Elayne Logan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logan said she believes she would rather have a teacher talk about what&#8217;s in now rather than a teacher who sticks to the &#8220;old fashion&#8221; way of teaching, which doesn&#8217;t really work nowadays. Logan said that because most teachers have a stuck mindset on how teaching can be, they close themselves off to improvement and that’s what stops them from being a good teacher because they’re not willing to improve how they teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most teachers don&#8217;t really care if you actually understand, some are just trying to make it to payday. The ones who choose to stick around for so long are proven to be a good teacher,”&nbsp; More said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to differentiate between the teachers who actually teach because they want their students to learn and the teachers who teach because they’re just there for the money, More said. According to More, when you find a teacher who is genuinely concerned if you are managing the workload given, that makes them a great teacher.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each and every person has their own views on what can be considered “good” in this world but it’s your job to be able to identify why the specific thing you’re leaning toward would be considered to be a “good” thing or position.<a href="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-7206" src="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="317" srcset="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg 475w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-122x80.jpg 122w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-120x80.jpg 120w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060.jpg 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></a></span></p>
