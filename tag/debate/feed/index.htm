										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With quarantine keeping students all holed up inside their houses,&nbsp; students and teachers have had to come up with some creative ways to keep in contact, especially with school and after school clubs. But Covid-19 has not stopped the debate team from progressing and moving forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, the debate club chooses a topic to learn about and discuss in debates. This year, the topic is criminal justice. The students then prepare evidence and pair up with another student to face off with another student pair in front of at least one adult judge. But now, instead of doing the debates in-person, the debates take place within organized and structured Zoom meetings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong group of debaters has made overcoming this challenge easier according to the debate coach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have an incredible group this year,” said debate teacher, Peter Crevoiserat, who is better known as Mr. Crevo. “I have more students in debate this year than any of my previous years, which is exciting, and I hope that trend continues. (&#8230;) If more people stick with debate, the sky&#8217;s the limit.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophomore Makayla Coy says debating this year is challenging, but still rewarding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A typical debate meeting now is kind of crazy from what it used to be,” Coy said.” “This was me and my partner’s first year, so we’ve gotten a grip on things. It’s been hard, but if you put your mind to it then it’s okay. (&#8230;) Other than that debate is great and I’m glad I joined it.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team has gone to three tournaments thus far, placing 3rd in two tournaments overall. The current top pair, consisting of Rylee Lopez and Josee Hoshaw, have placed in every tournament. Taking 2nd place at the Ad Astra tournament, 5th place at Wichita East, and 3rd place at Salina South. The pair consisting of Tristan Rice and Jack Rue took 4th place in Salina South.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Crevo stated that this has been a great season so far for the debate team, he just needs more participants. If you have any questions for Mr. Crevo or would like to join the debate team, please contact him via his email: pcrevoiserat@usd259.net</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first 2020 presidential campaign kicked off with a fiery debate this past Tuesday between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. With both candidates giving two minute answers to questions about Covid-19, police brutality and mass incarceration, it gave voters a lot to consider.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with multiple positive comments about health care and controlling the Coronavirus, came a lot of controversy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Biden calling Trump “un-presidential” and a “clown”, and Trump firing back with “I’ve done more in 47 months than you have in 47 years” and arguing with the moderator, it was a wild ride from start to finish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some students think that the debate showed that Trump was not presidential material.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump’s not really a politician,” Lenna Roberts stated. “We basically elected a businessman to be our president.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While another student said she felt like Trump was not forthcoming with his answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raena Ford said, “He’s a question dodger. He always changes the subject.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This over two hour long debate was monitored by journalist and news anchor Chris Wallace. He was asked about his opinion on the debate and he was not pleased.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never dreamt that it would go off the tracks the way that it did,” Wallace said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debate teams from the greater Wichita area convened at Northwest after school on Aug. 22 to attend a conference prepared by Bill English of Baylor University to start the debate season.</p>
<p>Over the course of four hours, debaters took notes with laptops and good old fashioned legal pads and pencils hoping to get a jump start into the new year and discuss topic ideas.</p>
<p>Every year the topic changes, this year features Mexico, Venezuela and Cuba, and ways to economically engage them.</p>
<p>English went to many summer debate camps to find out which cases were going to be used most, and then presented arguments and extra evidence for the affirmative side.</p>
<p>“I’m going to make the affirmative cases seem like the best thing since sliced bread, then I’ll make it seem like it will never win,” said English as he explained how the night would go.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that such a conference has been held for Wichita debaters, nor is it the first time Northwest has been the host.</p>
<p>Shawn Wingfield, the current coach, mentioned that it has been held here every year since he became coach, and even before he became coach.</p>
<p>“We are always delighted Baylor University chooses Wichita Northwest as the school to kick off the debate season,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite this, due to every seat being 25 dollars, in the past, Northwest students have not been able to attend, so the debate team was excited to be able to attend this year.</p>
<p>“I’m very interested to see what he has to say,” sophomore Megan Harvey said. “I don’t really understand the topic, and this guy has stuff that will get us ahead.”</p>
<p>In addition to the notes that were taken on the ideas and evidence presented, each debater received a packet of information that otherwise would have taken debaters hours to find and write into debate format.</p>
<p>Not everyone felt that the experience was entirely positive.</p>
<p>After the conference took a break for dinner, Senior Daniel Wise felt that “It was interesting, and I’m getting some new stuff, but I already know some of this and a lot of it feels rehearsed.”</p>
<p>However people felt about the conference itself, it did not change the fact that Northwest is looking forward to another great year-and THAT is something not up for debate.</p>
