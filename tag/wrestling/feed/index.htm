										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Northwest wrestling team finished the regular season unbeaten in every dual. To top it off, the wrestlers won the City League tournament.   </p>
<p>They have continued an impressive winning streak for the past four years thanks not only to the athletes, but also to the coaches like Eric Prichard.</p>
<p>“We have good kids but also the coaching staff has been coaching together for 20 years which helps with consistency and leadership,” Prichard said.</p>
<p>The wrestling team has been consistently winning their duals and hope to continue the winning streak.</p>
<p>“We have won our 48th straight dual in a row which goes back four years,” Prichard said.</p>
<p>Both the JV and Varsity wrestling teams won the championship at the City League Tournament Saturday, Feb. 14th. </p>
<p>“It was a great feeling winning individually and as a team,” senior Saul Ortiz said.  “We proved that we were the best.”</p>
<p>The state wrestling tournament takes place Saturday, Feb. 28th at Hartman Arena. </p>
<p>“I’m excited for state and showing people what we can do,” Ortiz said.</p>
<p>Their success has depended not just on physical strength but also the mental strength of a person during a match.</p>
<p>“Its just you out there and that’s hard,” Prichard said. “Whether you win or lose is totally on you and that’s tough.”</p>
<p>Senior Matt Washee understands just how hard it is to give your all physically and mentally.</p>
<p>“The hardest part is fighting through the mental part of wrestling and being mentally tough,” Washee said.</p>
<p>The real key to the Grizzlies’ success, however, is the teamwork and effort they invest.</p>
<p>“We as a team work hard and push each other,” Washee said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Nigg was nominated for the Coach of the Year award and inducted into the Wrestling Hall of Fame located in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The banquet to honor him will be held in Derby on April 19.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s really an honor,&#8221; Nigg said. &#8220;Usually, a lot of times they&#8217;ll wait to nominate you until you die. But I&#8217;m still around.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is being honored for the second overall win-loss record, having over 184 dual wins, multiple appearances in the top four at state, and winning state. Additionally, he is being recognized for being a part of the wrestling community for so many years. </p>
<p>Being around for 38 years, Nigg has worked with assistant coach Mike Church and Eric Prichard, head coach of the wrestling team. Including the years Prichard wrestled for Nigg, they have been together for a total of 23 years. Nineteen of those have been coaching.</p>
<p>“I wrestled for him back in 1988 for six years, four years in highschool and two in college.” Prichard said. “I went to college, came back in 1996 and started coaching with him. He’s been so successful here, we’re proud of him and I think it was about time.”</p>
<p>Prichard will also be attending the banquet, as well as introducing the hall of famer. Nigg will receive a plaque and a jacket.</p>
<p>Setting aside his award and success, he says it’s not for the recognition, but for the students and to teach them the sport. </p>
<p>“It’s rewarding to be surrounded by such good kids, not to just wrestle for college, but to have success,” Nigg said.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest’s wrestling team has been accomplishing all they set out for so far this season. The team is 5-0 in the City League. “We have eight kids ranked for state already, so I’d say that we’re doing well,” wrestling coach Eric Prichard said. The team has won every tournament they have been to so far including Wellington, Pratt, and Bishop Carrol. “The team is right where I want them to be right now,” Prichard said. Northwest is going for their 3rd straight City League championship. “I really want us to go for a three-peat, I don’t think its been done before yet,” Prichard said. The wrestlers most recently had a 49-18 win against Heights on Wednesday, Jan. 29. “I’m looking forward to finishing the year strong, and really hoping for a top three finish at state this year,” Prichard said.</p>
