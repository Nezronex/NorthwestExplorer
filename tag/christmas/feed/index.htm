										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With&nbsp; Christmas right around the corner Amazon has been really busy with people buying gifts. Amazon has list of popular gift ideas for different ages. These list have been really helpful for kids who don’t know what they want and for people who don’t know what to buy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be difficult to buy Christmas gifts for children who are newborns to 2 years old. Things that amazon has to offer for newborn children are books some that are normal and ones that talk, onesies, baby toys, and baby tooth brushes. For kids who are older there are bigger toys on the website. They offer kids appliances like washers, fridges, and ovens that young kids would sure enjoy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids who are 3-5 years old start to get into more character toys. Amazon offers many different character toys that young children would enjoy. They have Paw patrol, super heroes and baby yoda. They also offer LOL, Barbie, and baby shark. They also have non character things like play doh, coloring activities , and stuffed animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For children 6-8 amazon offers a little more advanced toys and activities. They offer more complex Lego city, Lego friends, Lego avengers, and Lego Minecraft sets. They also offer S.T.E.M sets, jewelry sets, and art sets. There is also a couple popular board games like mousetrap, clue, and chutes &amp; ladders on the site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids who are 9-11 are in the weird faze where they aren’t little kids but not teens yet. Amazon offers many different toys that would fit their ages and interests. They offer many things for artistic kids like spirograph, 3D coloring puzzles, blank comic books, how to draw books, water color painting, and rock painting sets. For the kids who like more hands on things they have slime kits, rubix cubes, Legos, chemistry sets, break open geodes, and origami. For the kids who like games they have chess, sorry, Tetris, lightning reload shocking game, dabble, and monopoly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teens are in the time where they don’t really play with toys so it’s harder to shop for them. Amazon offers many different electronics and add ons for the electronics. They sell Nintendo switches, just dance, Mario cart, controllers, smart watches, tablets, speakers, echo dots, and TV’s. They have board/card games like exploding kittens, what do you meme?, giant checkers, giant connect 4, and stranger things eggo card game. They also have other things like snack boxes, ring lights, clothing, picture printers, art sets, and guitars.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon offers many gift ideas to help anyone out with shopping.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Christmas less than a month away, people of all ages are starting up their annual Christmas traditions. Whether it’s with family, friends or significant others, seemingly everyone has some sort of holiday tradition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Hofhine spends her time bonding with her siblings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every Christmas Eve, me and my little siblings build a tent out of blankets and sheets and whatever we can find,” Hofhine said. “We put lights up around it in the living room and we all sleep in the tent.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to hanging out with siblings, Ameara Clark gets to visit another relative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I go to my aunt’s house on Christmas Eve every year,” Clark said. “She’ll make a big dinner (I get a WHOLE pan of green bean casserole for myself) and we&#8217;ll trade white elephant gifts and eat cake balls.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesley Buser also has exciting traditions involving food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In normal years, my grandma holds a gingerbread house decorating party with homemade houses, cookies, sandwiches, soups, and then holiday ice cream,” Buser said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America isn’t the only one with Christmas traditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British kids are well acquainted with Father Christmas, Santa Claus or Saint Nick, but they can consider themselves lucky they don&#8217;t live in Austria, where a ghoulish creature called &#8216;Krampus&#8217;, the evil accomplice of St Nicholas, is said to wander the streets in search of badly-behaved children. During the month of December you can expect to see terrifying masked figures out and about scaring kids and adults alike with ghastly pranks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unusual tradition comes from Iceland, where a giant cat is said to roam the snowy countryside at Christmas time. Traditionally farmers would use the Yule Cat as an incentive for their workers &#8211; those who worked hard would receive a new set of clothes, but those who didn&#8217;t would be devoured by the gigantic cat-like beast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this year, most cannot celebrate Christmas like they’re used to, because of Covid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how the Coronavirus has impacted Chesley Buser’s Christmas traditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So my grandpa&#8217;s birthday is Christmas Eve and we normally have a bunch of parties to celebrate him and of course Christmas,&#8221; Buser said &#8220;We have a bunch of my family come down but this year it will just be my immediate family of me, my sister, mom, dad, mama, and papa. It will definitely be smaller but I hope that by next year things will be better,&#8221; Buser said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Is it just me, or are people trying to turn CHRISTmas into credit-cardmas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As we get into the holiday season, people start hanging their lights, baking their cookies and pop in CD’s of Mannheim Steamroller and generally try to get into the holiday spirit. Lately, however, it seems that stores are selling Christmas rather than celebrating it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, I’m not saying that stores shouldn’t sell Christmas items or anything like that. Stores sell what people want, that’s their job. It would be horrible business sense not to sell Christmas lights and boughs of holly. When something is popular, whether it is the latest trend or if it is a holiday, stores cater to what people will buy. There is nothing wrong with that. I would be the first to say that there would be a riot in my household if Braum’s didn’t sell their seasonal Gingerbread ice-cream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What I have a problem with is when people spend so much, when people shove aside the reason Christmas is such an important holiday and stores commercialize Christmas to the point that it doesn’t really look like Christmas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A recent example of this is Black Thursday. Wal-Mart lowered their Black Friday prices a day early in order to tempt people to shop at Wal-Mart instead, and this act encroached on what was supposed to be a holiday to give thanks for what had come to us and what we have. While this wasn’t an example that pertained to Christmas, it is just one of many examples of corporations not respecting the fine line between selling products and making the holidays all about money and themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another example is the stores that sell Christmas decorations and Santa suits around Halloween. Really?  You could not have waited? What about the commercials that encourage you to spend a little something on yourself? How many commercials do you see that say that Santa supports buying a flat screen versus the amount of ads encouraging you to put a few dollars into a Salvation Army bucket? Clearly Americans have their priorities and reasons for Christmas in order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">All in all, it is getting to the point that people would rather celebrate Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer and Santa than the real reason for the season. Instead of being the college that had to be pressured to remove their Christmas tree ban, maybe we should actually think about why we celebrate Christmas, why we are rejoicing. Then celebrate Christmas instead of buying Christmas without actually thinking about why you are spending or why this time of year is special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">No matter how much I rant in order to attempt to get my point across, Linus said it best when Charlie Brown asked what Christmas was all about:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">And there were in the same country shepherds, abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them! And they were sore afraid … And the angel said unto them, “Fear not! For, behold, I bring you tidings o great joy, which shall be to all my people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ, the Lord.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.” And suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God, and saying, “Glory to God in the Highest, and on Earth peace, and good will toward men.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.</p>
