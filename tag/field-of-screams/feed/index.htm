										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fall is here, but COVID concerns may limit ways to celebrate the season. However, all around Wichita there still remain countless things to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safety precaution because COVID is limiting activities makes it to where people stay safe but also have the ability to have fun and do the things people enjoy with their family. Cox farm is offering a kiddie corn maze and a pumpkin patch this year to families who are interested. On the Cox farms website, it has a countdown to when Halloween is and the website does list about their history and the main attractions such as the market that is open year-round Monday through Saturday 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. The fall festival is promoted to be a safe way to celebrate with the family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;This year the annual Wicked Island is still being hosted at OJ Watson park for a fun attraction. There are also activities such as going to Corn mazes and picking out pumpkins to carve. On the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wicked Woods </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website, it promotes and states that face masks are required. It also states that anyone who buys a ticket will be provided with a face mask and that if you donâ€™t abide by the rules and regulations by wearing the mask you will be asked to leave. The annual escape room is not available this year for safety reasons because of COVID. The website states that all sales are final and that by purchasing a ticket you are agreeing to abide by the rules. Wicked Island is a 30-minute walk through in which you encounter ghosts and goblins and, the occasional scream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Field of Screams this year for Halloween and is another option when looking at fall activities. Field of Screams is the e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">xperience of the haunted grounds of the Spurlock family and see first-hand where the infamous vigilante murders took place. It states on the website that masks are required and that the field of screams is not recommended for young children and the events for the field of screams take place at night and are available on the weekend all through the month of October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are tons of fun activities to encounter this year even with the virus you just have to put yourself out there and be willing to make the best out of the experience.</span></p>
