										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Northwest High School’s main priority has always been to protect their students. In the past few years, we have seen many ways this has been updated and enforced. For example, checking ID’s at football games and our recent safety feature from last year, the metal detectors. The newest addition we have is the policy that we must wear our ID’s on school lanyards while being inside of the school.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my other years of attending Northwest, you always had to receive an ID. It had a few main purposes like scanning the barcode for breakfast in the morning and giving solid proof that you were an upperclassman so you could get back into the school during lunch. Now it’s purpose is to ensure that you’re a student at the school, not a random person wandering the hallways. Continuously wearing the ID was created as a policy because of the increased amount of dangers happening inside of schools over the past few years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it can be seen as a way to keep students and staff safe inside of the school, it has proven to have many faults as well. A main issue with the new policy is the fact that if you happen to forget your ID at home one day, you must go to security and buy a new one. This can be incredibly inconvenient for some if they happen to be running late, they’d have to stand in a line to get themselves another ID. This also brings up the problem of money issues and not being able to buy yourself a new one every time you accidentally forget yours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another disadvantage with the ID system is that they can be incredibly uncomfortable which causes many disturbances. The lanyard material can scratch against your neck, or be pulled if it’s accidentally caught on something. There’s also been instances of the lanyard getting stuck in long amounts of hair, and that’s never fun to untangle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly though, the central problem regarding the ID’s is always having to wear them around our necks. Having them in our hands seems like it’d be obvious that we do go to the school. So when teachers consistently tell us in the hallway to put them on, it can seem pointless.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are quite a few things that could be taken into account to make the system easier for both parties. For instance, allowing the students the choice to bring their own type of lanyard. That could fix the issue of discomfort, seeing as you could choose your own material. Another solution could potentially be giving a little more leniency towards people who do forget their ID. Just like with tardies, you’re given a few free passes before it’s a lunch detention, that system could be tested with the IDs. So while many dislike this new policy, there’s several ways to update the conditions so that both the student body and faculty are content, and our safety is ensured.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s the end of the year and you know what that means, finals! Students are preparing for the biggest tests they will take in their classes this semester. It&#8217;s crunch time, getting all assignments in is a big priority. Here&#8217;s a little bit from Izabella Scheufler(10) a student on their feelings about finals.</p>
<p><strong>What finals do you have?</strong><br />
Aquatics, English ,history, JROTC, zoology, chemistry, Spanish, algebra 2.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like your teachers have done a good job of preparing you for your finals?</strong><br />
Yes! If the finals aren&#8217;t something I could prepare for myself, my teachers give us review packets or small quizzes to help us get ready.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts about finals?</strong><br />
Finals are usually a really stressful part of the school year.</p>
<p><strong>How have finals gone for you in the past years?</strong><br />
The past years&#8217; finals have been a little chaotic because I have them in every class but I feel accomplished after they are over with.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">A pungent smell invades the nostrils of Abby Fickle as she frantically grabs the keepsakes from her car. A sense of urgency seems to drown out the chaos, she grabs the last of her things that she can get at this moment and takes off. Away from her precious car as it is engulfed in flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Abby Fickle, a junior at Northwest who loved her car, a Volkswagen Beetle nicknamed Spike, an astronomical amount. For Abby and her friend Tianna Piña it was a fairly normal lunch at the start of a new year. They had just gotten into Abby’s car and had attempted to turn on the air conditioning. It turned on but both of them noticed a sliver of smoke emerging from the controls. At this point in time they still drove it around this is where the first signs of trouble started appearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The smell started becoming something very very strong to the point where you could feel it inside your stomach and made you grossed out,” Tianna Piña, (11), said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">After a while things started picking up, according to Tianna and Abby. The smoke grew darker black and increased in quantity. The stench carried by it became even more gut-wrenching at this point in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The black smoke kind of reminded me of a house fire, but luckily we were just in a car, so we could get out safely,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the black smoke started sweeping through her car, Fickle drove back to school grounds. Thinking quickly, Fickle drove her car into the parking lot away from other vehicles, calling her dad for advice and help. They opened up the hood and in the process discovered the fire on the side of her car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“He told us to disconnect the cable from the battery just in case that would help, and as I rounded the corner of the car we saw the fire fuming,” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the fire raged on, the windows were the first to break due to the intense heat. After that,&nbsp; Fickle and Piña were escorted away from the vehicle and into the nurse’s office. There the realization of what had truly happened hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“What was going through my mind was&nbsp; something that was new to me, and I don’t know why I reacted this way, but I started laughing,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">While Piña felt hysteria, Fickle understandably felt pure sadness not only that, but also she had endured a borderline traumatic experience. At the nurse’s office both were found to be healthy, despite all circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“I kept getting reminded by dad whenever I was sad about it, that if I had done anything different we both could have died, or something worse could have happened” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">The car itself was totaled, a large portion of it completely destroyed by flames. Fickle only had liability insurance though, leaving her without a vehicle at this moment, but Fickle does have plans to bring back some life back into an old mustang her sister owned.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“It’s weird, a change, but we worked on it all day and now I drive that,” Fickle said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conjoined lunches are new to returning Northwest students and have sparked a little concern throughout the school. Some students are worried about Covid spreading, not enough places to sit, and the long lunch lines. Cooper Schmitz, a junior, is one of many that agree with this.</p>
<p>“It’s weird. It’s a love-hate thing because there are too many people and it gets crowded. It’s also impossible to make a turn out of the school when I want to go somewhere,” Schmitz said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the downsides to the conjoined lunch, there are always ups. Freshman Aaliyah Clark likes the conjoined lunch.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a great way for people to socialize with all the upperclassmen. I also think that it is really crowded, there are always seats taken, and the lunch line is exceedingly long, and waiting in it is just a waste of time,” Clark said.</p>
<p>Many more students at Northwest can agree that the conjoined lunch isn’t the best because of the lack of seats and not enough time to get your lunch and eat it. Overall, they are many ups and downs that the conjoined lunch has brought to Northwest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;Devious Licks&#8221; trend popularized on TikTok, is causing hardship for both students and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having to clean up everything that students have ruined is very difficult for all the staff. Replacing things that have been stolen takes money away that could be used for other things. Staff members say that this trend is childish and it needs to stop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is very frustrating as a school administrator to put up with the needless vandalism,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the thought of somebody putting this out there on TikTok as the devious licks trend…motivates students to vandalize their own school. We don’t have a choice but to shut them down to repair and clean up,” Principal Eric Hofer-Holdeman said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Many students are tired of the inconveniences resulting from the theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I used to go to a school where we didn’t have toilet paper, soap and nothing. The fact they’re taking it away is making me a little bit uncomfortable. Some of my friends said someone stole a urinal and I didn’t understand until I saw it on tikTok and then I actually saw someone take warning signs,” Fabiola Finol-Colina (10) said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with stealing things, students are also destroying property and basic necessities. Jimmie Belden, custodian, says it makes his job harder trying to replace everything on a daily basis. Tiffany Hampe, math,&nbsp;also agrees that the trend is “ridiculous”. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students around Northwest have many intriguing opinions on Donda vs CLB. Kanye West’s album “Donda” dropped on August 29, and Drake&#8217;s album “CLB or Certified Lover Boy” dropped on September 3. Creating an ongoing battle between who produced the better album.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students at Northwest have very strong opinions on which is better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donda is trash, that&#8217;s all I have to say,&#8221; Ethan Engelking (10) said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many students around Northwest agree with Engelking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CLB was better,” Tanner Martin (12)&nbsp; said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, by far Certified Lover Boy surpassed Donda at Northwest High School. But, not just at Northwest, CLB had sold 613,000 equivalent album units and, Donda only sold 309,000 album units. Declaring a winner in the CLB vs Donda battle.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent times, the topic of masks and vaccines has been really popular. With Covid cases on the rise, many believe both masks and vaccines should be mandated while others are completely against it and think they should be able to decide what’s best for their safety. In Wichita Public School’s this has been a big debate, especially because of the board&#8217;s decision to start the school year off with masks being strongly recommended instead of mandating them like they have in the past. We asked people how they felt about this policy and here is what some had to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that it is kind of political in asking people to require to wear masks, although I think if we just all do it then it would get this over a lot quicker. We should’ve done this last year, although lots of people do not always follow directions.” an anonymous source said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people agree with this statement, others have different opinions, such as an anonymous freshman who understands why the mask policy is what it is.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ I think the policy is pretty fair because everybody has a choice instead of it being forced upon people,” stated&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as the topic of masks many people have strong opinions on vaccines, such as Mr. Mays, the choir teacher.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“I’m very pro-vaccine. I think vaccines work, and I think honestly that probably we should get it mandated&nbsp; for the schools because that&#8217;s what we’ve been doing&nbsp; for decades. We’ve been having kindergarteners that have had to have several vaccines before they could ever show up and so if we wanted to really nip it in the bud we could do that,” stated Mays.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alondra Mena-Chavez, a Sophomore, has a very similar opinion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think they are helping ‘cause most of the people dying from covid are the ones without the vaccine,” stated Mena-Chavez.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Reagan Faulkner, a senior, has a very contrasting view on how she feels about the COVID vaccine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“No, because I don’t trust them because of the side effects and because I’ve seen the numbers of people who have been paralyzed, had miscarriages, have adverse effects, heart attacks, all of that,” stated Faulkner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a different note, there’s many reasons as to why people choose to or don’t choose to wear a mask.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do not, just because I just don&#8217;t feel comfortable wearing it. I feel like I&#8217;m safe. I’ve had covid before but it wasn’t that big of a deal for me. I know people that have personally been affected by it, badly, but I just feel like I don&#8217;t need it,” stated an anonymous source.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to this we have Rubi Loya, a sophomore, who said, “I choose to wear a mask to not only protect myself and my family, but also those around me and so I can keep coming to school and not have to quarantine.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone has their own opinion, some are pro, others are against. In the end this is a rough time of everyone&#8217;s lives and it will take everyone being together to make the rough times a little easier. Following guidelines regardless of opinions is one way to be in this together.</span></p>
