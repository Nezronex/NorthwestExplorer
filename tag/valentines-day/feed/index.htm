										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The library is now offering a blind dating service. A blind date with a book, that is.</p>
<p>To try to encourage reading, certain books are now being concealed in Valentine’s day themed wrapping paper, waiting to be picked up. Students are then encouraged to pick up one of the “mystery” novels, take it to the checkout counter, then unwrap it to discover what book they are having a “blind date” with. </p>
<p>The rules are simple: read at least 30 pages. When you finish, come back and rate your book on a scale from “horrible” to “amazing.”  </p>
<p>“I really want to try it. It sounds really cool,” says freshman McKayla Siemiller. </p>
<p>The hope is that the draw of the unknown will tempt more kids to read.</p>
<p>“Books are important because they are real people’s stories, and you get to experience and understand another world, another person’s feelings and experiences. Reading makes us better people,” says Lizanne Minerva.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Citizens of the United States traditionally spend St. Valentines day giving roses, cards, candy and giant fluffy teddy bears to the object of their affection. Valentine’s day can be called something different in other countries because it has a different origin; therefore they have different traditions. Here is a list of how other countries spend the day celebrating love.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scotland: Although it is not country-wide, a popular activity in Scotland is to walk out, and the first person of the opposite gender you see is your Valentine for the day. So, you may be spending Valentine’s day with a stranger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Japan: The Japanese Valentine’s day is sort of a two-parter. The females give the boys chocolate on valentines day (usually homemade) and a month later, on White day, the men that the chocolate was given to return the favor by giving the girls a gift two-to-three times the amount of money the chocolate was worth with something white: usually it is white chocolate, but marshmallows and white clothing work okay too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russia: Russia did not celebrate Valentine’s day until the collapse of the USSR, so they don’t have deep-rooted traditions. They mainly do the same things the United States does, although there is an area in Russia that banned Valentine’s day, because it celebrated being in love, not true love.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Germany: While they also have the traditional exchanging of flowers and chocolate, the Germans sometimes  include pigs in the celebration, because of their color and because they represent luck.</p>
<p dir="ltr">China: While most of the world have plenty of things in common, with a few unique things that come with that particular culture, China is very different. They celebrate on the seventh eve of the seventh month on the chinese calendar.  The Chinese believe that rain of Valentines day is the tears of a separated couple in Chinese legends and girls arrange sticks of fruit and incense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valentines Day, the day every year where people either feel loved by their significant other or the day where people stay at home wishing they were feeling loved. If you’re one of those people who is feeling a bit lonely this year, here are some tips for a better Valentines Day.<br />
1. Hang out with friends, (lets be honest they’re probably just as lonely as you are).<br />
2. Buy yourself flowers, and act surprised when you receive them.<br />
3. Watch romantic movies and eat ice cream, crying when you please.<br />
4. Go to Applebee’s and order the 2 for $20 menu all for yourself.<br />
5. Dress up nice and take yourself out on a date to the movies.<br />
6. Have your mother buy you a giant teddy bear from Dillon’s that way you have something to cuddle with at night.<br />
7. Take a nap, (because who doesn’t love sleep)?<br />
8. Throw a party with all the other singles and enjoy your night!<br />
9. Go on a run to start getting that body you’ve always wanted.<br />
10. Go out with friends and meet someone new because you’re way too amazing to be sitting at home by yourself.<br />
These tips are to have a fun lonely Valentines Day, but Valentines Day is just another day in the year that you could spend making fun memories, don’t let feeling lonely bring you down this year.</p>
