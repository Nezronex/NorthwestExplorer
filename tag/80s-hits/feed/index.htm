										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The finals policy might change next year for Northwest students. Students of all grades and class levels may be required to take finals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our district is planning on college career readiness,” principal Gil Alvarez said, “but no decisions are certain.” If finals are required the difficulty won’t change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Many schools in USD 259 are already requiring their students to take all their finals,” Alvarez said. “As far as I know all students will have to take finals in college.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The teachers also have some input. “The teaching staff has been asked to take a survey regarding finals policy,” said history teacher Dennis Cox. “It’s a disservice to the students not to prepare them.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once in college the students will have to take finals and in some cases midterms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Finals week tends to be much more stressful to students who haven’t taken them before,” Cox said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The students of Northwest are very opinionated on the subject.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I wouldn’t take any hard classes,” said sophomore Lien Vu.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some are irritated. “I’d be pretty mad,” said freshman Kelton Simkins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decision isn’t final, and they’re still debating the matter. For now the students will just continue the same procedures they have always done.</p>
