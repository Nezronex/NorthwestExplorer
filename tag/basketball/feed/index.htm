										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Northwest girls basketball team had a sad ending to their season of hard work that left them emotional on Wed. March 5. The team lost to Garden City in a 66-40 game, resulting in them being eliminated from qualifying for state.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At the beginning we were working really hard and doing well holding them, but they went on a run of points and we couldn’t stop them,” said sophomore Haley Cooper. At halftime the score 29-12 Garden City.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We went from a run of 8-0 at the beginning of the game to that, it was a little disappointing,” said Cooper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The game was played in Garden City, so the team had to stay after the loss to watch the Northwest boys play, who also had a tragic 3 point loss.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We were trying to be supportive of the guys during their game but when we got back into the locker room it was very emotional since it was the seniors last game,” said Cooper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team finished with a 9-12 record.</p>
<p>“Ultimately it would have been nice to have a happier ending, but it was a good experience, despite it all we functioned as a team unit and were supportive the whole season,” said Cooper.</p>
