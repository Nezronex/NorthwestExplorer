										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Construction is finally upon us. Northwest has heard about expansion for a while now, but did not know when it was supposed to happen. Initial site work started in August while the only construction that has started is for culinary arts and the CDC. Construction crews began breaking  ground earlier this month and started working on the band room.</p>
<p>“The band area, along with the culinary arts and FACS area,” Principal Gil Alvarez said, “should just be closed for this school year.”</p>
<p>The band room will also be a safe shelter after construction, and it should be up and running by the beginning of next school year. Doors are now closed in the G hall exit, the CDC entrance to the school, and the main entrance to the gym. All students trying to get into the gym or pool for athletic events must enter from the main Tyler Street doors.</p>
<p>“The gym area will probably be closed for two years,” Alvarez said.</p>
<p>Alvarez says exits being closed will be an inconvenience but will be manageable. With the East side area being fenced off, band students will only have one exit when walking out for practice and teachers have had to relocate for new places to park. This has caused a lot of congestion in both the Tyler and 13th parking lots. Another inconvenience is some of the routes to get out of the school during drills might have changed slightly.</p>
<p>“We just ask for flexibility during the construction stages because it’s going to be a lot of things going on,” Alvarez said, “and we want to make sure we allow that flexibility during the construction so it can be completed.”</p>
<p>There will be more changes happening throughout the year which should start in October.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Instead of this fall as previously planned, the bond issue will finally be enacted this upcoming March.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We were put on hold so long because we were put on the end of the list for the bond issue,” principal Gil Alvarez says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The issue will cover many renovations including a new gymnasium and band room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There was a part of the bond that was specifically set aside for Northwest back in 2008, but some things were added that are called alternates which are more things that we want than what we need,” Alvarez says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bond issue will also benefit the special education program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Right now they’re serving their students out of rooms that aren’t equipped to suit all of their needs, the special ed suite that is coming in is definitely needed,” Alvarez says.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bond issue has been common ground for Northwest principals, stretching from 2008 to 2013.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was a 2008 bond issue, I believe it’s actually been three principals before it actually broke ground,” Alvarez says.</p>
