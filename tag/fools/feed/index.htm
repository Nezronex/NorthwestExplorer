<p dir="ltr">On Feb. 20, 21, and 22, the Wichita Northwest Drama program performed the play Fools written by Neil Simon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The play was about a young Russian teacher, Leon Tolchinsky, that scored a job in a small village. When he arrives he finds out that all the citizens of the village have been cursed with Chronic Stupidity for 200 years. Confused and frustrated, just as he was giving up on teaching the citizens, he falls hopelessly in love with a stupid girl, who recently just learned how to sit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tolchinsky was played by Junior Joshua Peavey, and the stupid girl was played by Senior Paige Lundin. The two actors did a wonderful job playing their parts, and end the play without a dull moment. Peavey and Lundin had great on stage chemistry, and the rest of the crew did a wonderful job making the play worth watching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The play followed a dinner, and included a short 15 minute intermission, including dessert you could buy before you watched the second half. Richard Lundin, the director, did an amazing job putting together a wonderful, funny show that left the audience craving more.</p>
