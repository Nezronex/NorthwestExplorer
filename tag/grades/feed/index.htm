										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are 24 hours in the day, at least seven required to spend at school, and, according to scientists, nine hours of sleep are required for teenage brains. If you’re in sports, extracurriculars, have a job, or just need to keep up the social aspects of your life, that’d leave you with eight hours to spend on those activities, before you’d be required to cut into your sleep. </p>
<p>For Alyssa Hershey, time can appear crunched at times, and on some days, it’s a matter of choosing.  </p>
<p>Hershey is involved in several things, both in and out of school. Being involved in several shows at Music Theater for Young People (MTYP), Music Theater Wichita (MTW) and Wichita Children’s Theater &#038; dance Center (WTC &#038; DC) on top of school, higher level classes, church, band and even dance classes has lead to her having a jam-packed schedule.  </p>
<p>“It just kinda depends on what’s going on,” Hershey said, “Like how much is going on at that point. Right now, I’m handling it pretty well. A couple weeks ago, though, I was at a breaking point. AP classes, and end of the nine weeks, and being in two shows&#8211; it can just&#8211; it can get really tough.” </p>
<p>The current D and F list policies doesn’t affect Hershey due to her lack of participation in school sports, however her grades and extracurriculars such as: band, symphony, two dance classes, church Wednesday and Sunday, plus three advanced courses, can often lead her to having to make hard decisions and sacrificing things to find that balance. A few weeks back she had several shows and events packed into her short week, and found herself on the edge constantly. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t really sleeping that much, there was a few days in there where I didn’t sleep at all. It was really healthy,” Hershey said, “There were two nights where I pulled two all nighters in a row and I was just always doing something. Right after school I’d be in rehearsals until late and then I’d go straight home and do homework and just eat on the way. Then I’d be up all night doing homework and the next day I’d be doing it all over again. There was a couple times where I almost had a meltdown.”</p>
<p>Although Hershey doesn’t have to worry about not being able to perform if her grades dip down into the lower levels, not all students are as lucky. Business teacher Jeff Darr believes that it’s all a matter of finding a balance, which can be hard with all the things offered at Northwest, and even more so after they added an extra hour a couple years ago. </p>
<p>“There is a point that we need to, as administrators and teachers, I think we need to at least look at the number of classes that we changed two years ago. we went from seven periods to eight periods in terms of classes that students could potentially have projects, homeworks, tests, and things of that nature.” </p>
<p>Principle Alverez believes the D and F list is a good change for Northwest and thinks it should be seen as a positive thing. He wants it to be something to keep students, and teachers aware and seeking help if they need it. </p>
<p>“I think the D and f list was meant to be more of an awareness, not a punishment. The list came about because our athletic teams wanted to have a code of conduct that was tied into the d and f list that tied into the students grades. You had to have several ds and fs before you had your first warning week and after that week if it didn’t come up then there were consequences rather it be no playing time or what not. I think everybody thought that you could only have one D or F but that’s not the case, the case is we’re trying to get students into torturing, in to see their teacher&#8211; We’re trying to make it student friendly and not just a complete punishment.”</p>
<p>Junior Taylor Webber counters. </p>
<p>“Basically it comes down to you can not have a social life, good grades, play a sport, have a job, and get sleep. It’s impossible. How am I supposed to do my homework if I only get two hours of sleep? “</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Student athletes participating in fall sports for this year found themselves required to sign the Code of Player Conduct.</p>
<p>The Code of Player Conduct was created after last year’s accreditation process and was put in place to hold student athletes accountable for their grades. It states “If a student/athlete has any combination of 3 D’s and/or F’s there may be consequences. Consequences begin Tuesday of each week.”</p>
<p>There are mixed feelings about the requirements from students and some are more aware than others of the new rule that states that any combination of 3 D’s or F’s, will leave them ineligible to practice or play.</p>
<p>But it isn’t intended to be a punishment according to athletic director Lance Deckinger. He says it is a way to help students and their parents be more aware.</p>
<p>“It just helps out the coaches and makes it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades,” Deckinger said. “We’re holding the kids accountable and have had a couple comments even from parents like ‘I didn’t even know my kid had these grades,’ and it helps everyone keep an eye on what’s important.”</p>
<p>Deckinger says the first week is a warning week to let athletes know they need to improve their grades.</p>
<p>“If you’re on it a second week, we’ll see which direction your grades are going,” Deckinger said, “and if they’re going in the wrong direction you’re not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, then you can keep on playing.”</p>
<p>Some students have already felt the effects of the new requirements, but aren’t too upset. They just find themselves rushing to get things done so they can participate and support their team.</p>
<p>“The list affects the soccer team because if you don’t keep your grades up&#8230; the team’s going to be one player down and they won’t be complete,” sophomore Jesus Morales said.</p>
<p>“I had to miss one game. [Before] next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.”</p>
<p>Students are well aware of the requirements for their grades, but fail to realize that absences can also define whether you play or not.</p>
<p>According to the Code of Conduct, students must be in school to participate in a game or practice. If a student is excused for more than half of the day they are not allowed to participate in a practice and/or game.</p>
<p>“They send it [the list] out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that’s always been a problem of knowing whether they’re here or not,” cheer coach Tiffany Houle said. “If they’re not here that means no practice and no games.”</p>
<p><strong><strong></p>
<p></strong></strong></p>
<p>Absences, however, are also now defining whether you can participate or not.</p>
<p>“The D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.”</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“The list affects the soccer team because if you don’t keep your grades up you won’t play. The team’s going to be one player down and they won’t be complete,” said sophomore  Jesus Morales. “I was on the D &amp; F list and I had to miss one game. (Before) next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.”</p>
<p>“The D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.”</p>
<p>WE STARTED HAVING A D F LIST THIS YEAR. JUST MAKING SURE WE’VE HAD STUDENTS IN THE PAST THAT WEREN’T ALWAYS PASSING CLASSES</p>
<p>AND IT’S JUST IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU’RE PASSING YOUR  CLASSES. AND DOING WHAT YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HERE FOR YOUR EDUCATION BEFORE YOU’RE DOING EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY.</p>
<p>THE FIRST WEEK IS SORTA A WARNING WEEK, hey you got some grades down, get your grades up. IF YOU’RE ON IT A SECOND WEEK WE’LL SEE WHICH DIRECTION YOUR GRADES ARE GOING and if they’re going to wrong direction, hey go get your grades up, your’e not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, and then you can keep playing.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>You shouldn’t probably be participating in co-curricular activities If you’re having three or four ds or fs. So that’s what started the list, so coaches and students could keep up with it. Because in the past when they had 4 5 ds and fs, they really shouldn’t be on the field</p>
<p>Everyone just got on the same page and said it’s time to start improving it.</p>
<p>when we had our accreditation this past year, every five years they have the accreditation, one of the things that came up was students, people who have low grades participating in co-curricular activities, why are these students, if they’re having low grades, out there when they can’t take care of their grades.</p>
<p>It’s helped out the coaches and made it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades. Holding the kids accountable and we’ve had a couple comments even from parents like ‘I didn’t even my kid had these grades’ and it helps everyone keep an eye on what’s important.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Yes it is helpful because I don’t have to look it up myself, they send it out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that’s always been a problem of knowing whether they’re here or not. So I like that they send an attendance list every day so we know if they’re in school. So if they’re not here that means no practice, no games, which is nice because like I said, I used to have to look it up individually but now I don’t have to do that because every week I’m getting a list and I only have to find the girls that are getting Ds or Fs</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“ I’m not a big fan, but you gotta do what you gotta do. To me it’s just more paperwork that gets in the way of things. Is the concept good? Yes. Does it hold athletes to a higher standard? Yes. But we had less than one percent of athletes that have physicals turned in have issues with grades so I didn’t really think it was necessary.” said Cross Country coach Ron Russel</p>
