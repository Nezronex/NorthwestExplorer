										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northwest’s first Lunch and Learn was held last Tuesday in the CCC. Nineteen students gathered to listen to Suzy Thompson talk about what it&#8217;s really like to be a physical therapist.</p>
<p>Lunch and Learn offers a look into possible career choices for students by bringing in various professionals to discuss the everyday details of their job.</p>
<p>During first lunch on each third Tuesday of the month, students may meet in the CCC to listen to these area professionals.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of students that may join. If the discussions are successful, more meetings may be scheduled.</p>
<p>“Ms.Terriere  and I really wanted to set up the chance for students to talk to someone that does a real job,” College Career Coordinator Danea Cramer  said . “Not read about it or talk to someone from human resources, but actually sit down and say ‘What’s your day like? When you go to work, what’s the first thing you do? How do you determine how to manage your day? Where did you go to college? Do you need to go to college to do this job?”</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning about a potential career, see Cramer in room A26.</p>
