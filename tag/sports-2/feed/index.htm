										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest opened its new gym and hosted its first game on Jan. 19 against West. The updated gym has created many changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have some more space for cheerleading or other teams to practice on the upper deck behind the bleachers, brighter, nicer, it’ll hold more people,” athletic director Lance Deckinger said. “The new track makes it good for all P.E. classes, place for teams to workout with.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Northwest gym has many benefits to athletes, students, and teachers alike, including more space for students. Now the athletes can practice at the same time in the different gyms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before we couldn&#8217;t practice at the same time as the boys so our practices were longer,” sophomore Lucy Herter said. Now we can leave way earlier.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The athletic teachers have had to adjust to construction and now moving between the old and new gym but even they have no complaints as the gym is finally accessible.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It affected all of us, but in education you have to be flexible, patient, you have to roll with what happens and we did a good job with that,” gym teacher Jim Mernaugh said. “We get to spread out, we can have one class in the old gym and one in the new gym, another class in the weight room, and the more space. The new gym is beautiful.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the gym is being used, it is still not entirely finished yet because the old gym is still being transformed into a new weights room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gym’s not finished yet,” Deckinger said. “All the things aren&#8217;t done in it, but we’re playing in it right now. Everything at Northwest High school should be done by June.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Nigg was nominated for the Coach of the Year award and inducted into the Wrestling Hall of Fame located in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The banquet to honor him will be held in Derby on April 19.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s really an honor,&#8221; Nigg said. &#8220;Usually, a lot of times they&#8217;ll wait to nominate you until you die. But I&#8217;m still around.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is being honored for the second overall win-loss record, having over 184 dual wins, multiple appearances in the top four at state, and winning state. Additionally, he is being recognized for being a part of the wrestling community for so many years. </p>
<p>Being around for 38 years, Nigg has worked with assistant coach Mike Church and Eric Prichard, head coach of the wrestling team. Including the years Prichard wrestled for Nigg, they have been together for a total of 23 years. Nineteen of those have been coaching.</p>
<p>“I wrestled for him back in 1988 for six years, four years in highschool and two in college.” Prichard said. “I went to college, came back in 1996 and started coaching with him. He’s been so successful here, we’re proud of him and I think it was about time.”</p>
<p>Prichard will also be attending the banquet, as well as introducing the hall of famer. Nigg will receive a plaque and a jacket.</p>
<p>Setting aside his award and success, he says it’s not for the recognition, but for the students and to teach them the sport. </p>
<p>“It’s rewarding to be surrounded by such good kids, not to just wrestle for college, but to have success,” Nigg said.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, Chris Lambert took on his first year teaching at Northwest while balancing his second year coaching the Northwest baseball team.</p>
<p>Lambert teaches financial literacy, along with sports and entertainment marketing with Jeff Darr.  Before coming to Northwest, he taught for 16 years at West. </p>
<p>“I had a great experience at West,” said Lambert. “I learned a lot from the staff and I learned a lot, more importantly, from the students. But just like everything else, there comes a point in time where you’re ready to make a change and I was ready and luckily this job came open up here.”</p>
<p>As a coach, Lambert appreciates being in the same building as his players, because it allows him to watch over them more closely. </p>
<p>“Being here allows me to be in the same building as my players and that makes a difference,” said Lambert. “I think it’s important that the players see the coach in the building. They know I’m around and if they need anything I’m here, and likewise, I can find them a lot easier.”</p>
<p>Last season was Lambert’s first year coaching at Northwest, and he didn’t disappoint. He led the team to the state championship, where they took fourth out of 32 teams.<br />
The team is eager for March 2, when tryouts begin, but they know they’re going to face some challenges.  </p>
<p>“This year, led by the senior group of players that I’ve got, our expectation is to go back there and win a state title,” said Lambert. “But first we know that we have to take care of things before that, like winning the city league and then winning regionals to get us to that point. So we’re really excited about this year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Student athletes participating in fall sports for this year found themselves required to sign the Code of Player Conduct.</p>
<p>The Code of Player Conduct was created after last year’s accreditation process and was put in place to hold student athletes accountable for their grades. It states “If a student/athlete has any combination of 3 D’s and/or F’s there may be consequences. Consequences begin Tuesday of each week.”</p>
<p>There are mixed feelings about the requirements from students and some are more aware than others of the new rule that states that any combination of 3 D’s or F’s, will leave them ineligible to practice or play.</p>
<p>But it isn’t intended to be a punishment according to athletic director Lance Deckinger. He says it is a way to help students and their parents be more aware.</p>
<p>“It just helps out the coaches and makes it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades,” Deckinger said. “We’re holding the kids accountable and have had a couple comments even from parents like ‘I didn’t even know my kid had these grades,’ and it helps everyone keep an eye on what’s important.”</p>
<p>Deckinger says the first week is a warning week to let athletes know they need to improve their grades.</p>
<p>“If you’re on it a second week, we’ll see which direction your grades are going,” Deckinger said, “and if they’re going in the wrong direction you’re not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, then you can keep on playing.”</p>
<p>Some students have already felt the effects of the new requirements, but aren’t too upset. They just find themselves rushing to get things done so they can participate and support their team.</p>
<p>“The list affects the soccer team because if you don’t keep your grades up&#8230; the team’s going to be one player down and they won’t be complete,” sophomore Jesus Morales said.</p>
<p>“I had to miss one game. [Before] next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.”</p>
<p>Students are well aware of the requirements for their grades, but fail to realize that absences can also define whether you play or not.</p>
<p>According to the Code of Conduct, students must be in school to participate in a game or practice. If a student is excused for more than half of the day they are not allowed to participate in a practice and/or game.</p>
<p>“They send it [the list] out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that’s always been a problem of knowing whether they’re here or not,” cheer coach Tiffany Houle said. “If they’re not here that means no practice and no games.”</p>
<p><strong><strong></p>
<p></strong></strong></p>
<p>Absences, however, are also now defining whether you can participate or not.</p>
<p>“The D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.”</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“The list affects the soccer team because if you don’t keep your grades up you won’t play. The team’s going to be one player down and they won’t be complete,” said sophomore  Jesus Morales. “I was on the D &amp; F list and I had to miss one game. (Before) next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.”</p>
<p>“The D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.”</p>
<p>WE STARTED HAVING A D F LIST THIS YEAR. JUST MAKING SURE WE’VE HAD STUDENTS IN THE PAST THAT WEREN’T ALWAYS PASSING CLASSES</p>
<p>AND IT’S JUST IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU’RE PASSING YOUR  CLASSES. AND DOING WHAT YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HERE FOR YOUR EDUCATION BEFORE YOU’RE DOING EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY.</p>
<p>THE FIRST WEEK IS SORTA A WARNING WEEK, hey you got some grades down, get your grades up. IF YOU’RE ON IT A SECOND WEEK WE’LL SEE WHICH DIRECTION YOUR GRADES ARE GOING and if they’re going to wrong direction, hey go get your grades up, your’e not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, and then you can keep playing.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>You shouldn’t probably be participating in co-curricular activities If you’re having three or four ds or fs. So that’s what started the list, so coaches and students could keep up with it. Because in the past when they had 4 5 ds and fs, they really shouldn’t be on the field</p>
<p>Everyone just got on the same page and said it’s time to start improving it.</p>
<p>when we had our accreditation this past year, every five years they have the accreditation, one of the things that came up was students, people who have low grades participating in co-curricular activities, why are these students, if they’re having low grades, out there when they can’t take care of their grades.</p>
<p>It’s helped out the coaches and made it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades. Holding the kids accountable and we’ve had a couple comments even from parents like ‘I didn’t even my kid had these grades’ and it helps everyone keep an eye on what’s important.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Yes it is helpful because I don’t have to look it up myself, they send it out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that’s always been a problem of knowing whether they’re here or not. So I like that they send an attendance list every day so we know if they’re in school. So if they’re not here that means no practice, no games, which is nice because like I said, I used to have to look it up individually but now I don’t have to do that because every week I’m getting a list and I only have to find the girls that are getting Ds or Fs</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“ I’m not a big fan, but you gotta do what you gotta do. To me it’s just more paperwork that gets in the way of things. Is the concept good? Yes. Does it hold athletes to a higher standard? Yes. But we had less than one percent of athletes that have physicals turned in have issues with grades so I didn’t really think it was necessary.” said Cross Country coach Ron Russel</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A devastating loss by WSU in the March Madness tournament left much of Wichita and the Northwest student body brokenhearted after their game against Kentucky on Sun. March 23.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Both teams played a great game, unfortunately the last shot didn’t go in for the win,” sophomore Danielle Kastner said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">WSU managed a record-breaking 35-1 season that kept Wichita cheering for more, “I was at the Northwest YMCA when the game was on, all the people would go workout on the commercials and as soon as the game was back on they would all run back in and surround the TV,” sophomore Jacob Gilbertson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although they lost early on in the March Madness tournament Wichita is still showing their support wholeheartedly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The Shockers had an amazing season, they made history which no one in Wichita will ever forget,” Kastner said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wichita had one of the best records, coming from a small college in Kansas making people from all over watch.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to regret from this season, the team will come back even stronger next year and prove again what they can do,” Kastner said.</p>
