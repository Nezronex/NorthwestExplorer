										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year of 2015 has started, and reality is coming soon for the senior class of 2015. Don’t get me wrong, not having class all day is awesome, but I sit at home always thinking of what exactly I’m going to do with my life.</p>
<p>Many of us have already decided on what we’re doing after high school, college acceptance letters have arrived in your mailbox and the only thing you have to decide is what school you’re going to. </p>
<p>For the rest of us, we still don’t know what to do. It’s not that we don’t want to go to college, but we just can’t afford it, we want to work, or go into the military. Maybe some of us had plans, but they just didn’t turn out the way we wanted.</p>
<p>So, now what? Graduation is a day closer as the days go by. We’ve already presented our senior speeches, and the next big thing is probably prom.</p>
<p>I’m so stressed out, and I know many of you are too. I constantly ask myself, “What am I going to do after the summer is over?” My mom repeatedly asks how excited I am to finally graduate, but honestly I am dreading it. It’s not that I don’t want to graduate, it’s just, how am I going to become the person I have always wanted to be? How am I going to reach the top? Many of us are scared of failing, and I am probably the most scared.</p>
<p>I remember many people telling me that high school was going to fly by, and to never skip school because it was bad, and that it was going to be the best years of your life. Many of us can relate, and to be honest, those people were right. It was dumb to skip math (I found that out myself by spending my summer in summer school), and it was definitely not very smart to stress over things like boys and drama than missing out on football games and homecomings. </p>
<p>I do regret many things, like skipping out on the pep assemblies and not being involved in school more than I wanted to, but the end is coming soon, and there&#8217;s just no time to sit and think about all the things we could&#8217;ve done. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s live it up. Spend your last days like a true senior, smile, enjoy the last few walks through these halls, show your teachers a little more appreciation. Just a few more months until that diploma. </p>
<p>Overall, you can&#8217;t deny that these last 4 years weren&#8217;t worth it. </p>
<p>It’s ok to be scared for the future, just be bold. It’s ok to freak out, just stay on track. Don’t just dream, but make it all a reality. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Headaches, sleep loss, and the overwhelming urge to cry: these are all lovely signs of being stressed. It’s now December and the clock is ticking, wrapping up yet another year. Only one semester left after Christmas break for us seniors and my drive to do anything is at a negative seventy-five. It’s the time where we get questioned on a daily basis where we want to go to college and what we want to study. The only answer I can seem to formulate to these questions though, is that I have absolutely no idea.<br />
After being told what to do or where to go for 17 years, I am now expected to just make a life changing decision before I even turn 18. For some, the decision is easy but for others like me, it’s not. I’m horrible at making decisions, I can’t even decide what I want for dinner every night let alone what I want to do for the next four years.<br />
The clock on senior year keeps ticking and as it does, senioritis just gets worse. All I want to do is graduate and get out of here, but with all the tasks needing to be done, a part of me wants the clock to tick a bit slower.<br />
If someone had asked me where I wanted to go a few weeks ago I would have a clear cut answer, but one thought about money and I’m back to square one.<br />
Maybe I’ll just wing it.</p>
