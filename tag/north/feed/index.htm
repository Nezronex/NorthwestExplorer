										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Auditions for the North/Northwest collaboration of “Grease” were held in the Northwest auditorium on Aug. 21 and 22.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be a cool project,” North drama teacher Tyrone Galbreath said. “Lundin and I have been friends for a while so we thought we’d try this out and I think it’ll be kind of cool to bring two schools together and work on a project.”</p>
<p>Over 100 kids auditioned in the two day period.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>“Auditions are taking a little longer than I wanted but that’s really a good thing,” Northwest drama teacher Richard Lundin said. “That means that lots of kids are showing up.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Northwest girls won their first game 53-33 against North on Dec. 6, and demolished West in their second game  with a 67-21 score on Dec. 10.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s always a great experience,” sophomore Shaunece Grant said on her first year playing with the varsity team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The girls have started off great so far and are improving in their practices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So far as a team we have gotten better each game, so I hope that continues,” Grant said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve been turning the ball over a lot so we have been focusing on keeping the ball in practice, I think our hard work will pay off in our next game against South,” sophomore Haley Cooper said.</p>
<p>Their next game is on Tuesday, Dec. 17 at home against South.</p>
