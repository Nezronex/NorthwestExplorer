										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do you or anyone you know have trouble sleeping? If so, there&#8217;s a possible solution you should try.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since school has started, summer has ended, and everything is almost back to normal, sleeping schedules have changed quickly. It&#8217;s not unusual for teens to sleep late and wake up even later. Students have gotten out of the habit of going to bed early because they didn&#8217;t have to wake up as early last year. Because of that, many students have developed sleeping issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A great solution to this problem is melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that is released by the pineal gland at night time. It has been proven to to work with your sleeping cycle and train your mind to a sleeping schedule. Many people can lack melatonin in their system so now it can actually be taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ways to take melatonin can be pills or gummies. Gummies are more popular with kids and teens. The melatonin is infused into the gummies and pills. There are two types of melatonin, synthetic which is manmade, and natural which is made from animals pineal gland just like humans have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Depending on how much a person takes it could take some time to kick it but when it does you&#8217;ll feel it and eventually fall asleep. The more common amount of time it takes is 30 minutes. This is a great way to fall back into a healthy sleeping schedule.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshmen attended orientation on Monday, Aug. 17. The morning started with students locating their 9th hour classroom and meeting their Link Crew leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a nice system,” freshman Lucas Hofer-Holdeman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 357 students had the opportunity to tour the building, find their classrooms, and visit with their teachers and fellow freshmen classmates. J.C. White, freshman, is disturbed by how few of his classmates are his age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There aren’t many freshmen in all my classes,” White said. “I have upperclassmen in half of them which is going to be kind of awkward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshman Jake Wiggins shares a similar fear of the upperclassmen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m nervous about all the seniors,” Wiggins said. “I don’t want to be pushed around by people that are taller than me and have beards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hofer-Holdeman has had better experiences with his elders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve met some of the older students before and they’re really nice,” Hofer-Holdeman said. “The teachers are very friendly as far as I can tell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The class of 2019 will join the rest of the student body for the first full day of school on Tuesday, Aug. 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s confusing trying to get around the school,” White said. “It’s a lot of people trying to get around with just freshman. I can’t imagine what it’s like with all four classes here.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Locker doors, elaborately decorated with photos and posters, hung open during the day. Gym bags sat on top of the lockers&#8211;not inside of them. Buttons with football players’ names and faces were fashioned on sweater sleeves and backpack straps. The halls were filled with collared shirts, pleated skirts, cardigans and khakis.</p>
<p>This was my view during my day as a Bishop Carroll student on Friday, Sept. 19.</p>
<p>I attended a schedule similar to one I might attend at Northwest&#8211;besides the Religions class, which was taught by a nun. Many classes opened with a prayer and a sign of the cross.</p>
<p>Classes proceeded perhaps with less profanity, or perhaps with more veneration for their teachers. Little socializing went on&#8211;until lunchtime of course, where meals were served on dishes with silverware (no sporks or paper trays). Students are not allowed to leave.</p>
<p>During their five minute passing periods, students smiled and greeted one another, but rarely stopped walking on their way to class. I didn’t see a single couple holding hands or kissing. Hardly any students had their phones out, even during lunch.</p>
<p>I had the chance to attend their Eucharist Music Festival at the conclusion of the school day. In the gym, most of the students in the school knelt down before a table, topped with candles, on small pieces of carpet. For around an hour, they worshipped together in song and prayer.</p>
<p>Most of my classmates seemed to have no real break from their learning experience, and no significant desire to have one. They appeared to be so deeply engaged in their schoolwork.</p>
<p>Student relationships, both with each other and with teachers, seemed to be less developed than those at Northwest. Their population is less diverse. There does, however, seem to be such a strong sense of unity amongst Bishop Carroll students. The common goals at school, the prayers, rituals&#8211;all of it creates a bond that only they can share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one knows how another person lives until they walk a day in their shoes. I had the opportunity to do this, literally. My wardrobe was one of the many adjustments I had to make for shadowing at Bishop Carroll (BC).<br />
First and foremost, school uniforms aren’t as bad as they seem. It is nice to know what you are putting on each day without a single thought. They are also strangely comfortable. Almost everyone at BC wears Sperrys, as they fit into the strict dress code. At BC, there are no tattoos, piercings, long hair cuts (for guys), or any personalization allowed outside of designated spirit days. On game days, the boys are allowed to choose whatever tie or bowtie they want, as long as it is school appropriate.<br />
Carroll was also very undiverse. The number of non-white people was drastically less than at Northwest. It was shocking to be in a school where most of the classes I attended held only white people. Everyone I encountered was very nice, although several Carroll students commented that I may have mistaken fakeness for niceness. Even the teachers were very open and friendly towards me.<br />
The students seem much more connected as a student body there. Everyone seemed to know everyone, and even if someone didn’t like another person, they were still kind to each other. Although our student body doesn’t seem as connected as theirs, we seem to have closer relationships to our teachers. We get to know our teachers and build a mutual understanding of each others’ quirks and form an bond. Most of the students and teachers at Carroll did not seem to interact in the way we interact with our teachers. They are viewed more as strictly a teacher rather than an adult we not only respect and listen to, but can confide in and joke with.<br />
The main difference, as expected, was the religion everywhere you looked. I am a firm believer that religion and school should be separate, so this alone was a culture shock to me. There was praying in every other class, each unique in their own way. They have a religions class that is about the beliefs of the Catholic church. This class was especially hard for me, because my views are inherently different than any religion they affiliate with. I had to bite my tongue and remind myself to always be respectful when presented with views that contradicted my own.<br />
We visited during a Eucharistic Festival, an event where the Eucharist is placed in the middle of the gym and students kneeled and worshiped on carpet mats. There were a few prayers, a few songs, and a lot of time spent self-reflecting in silence. I have never witnessed a gym full of an entire school be completely silent, and that shows the respect these kids have for their religion. Many spent the entire hour of the festival on their knees, and some shed tears from being so touched.<br />
I walked a day in someone else’s Sperrys, and I have learned the everyday life of Catholic school, and as much as I respect the religion and values of the school, I prefer to spend my days at Northwest in my own checkered Vans.</p>

<ol>
<li>Respect authority, rules, peers, and staff. You’re only at school for seven hours, you can do it, promise.</li>
<li>Taking lots of notes helps out in the end. Even with how annoying and boring it is taking lots of notes, it makes it easier to study, especially for finals.</li>
<li>Remember, you aren&#8217;t alone. There are hundreds of teens experiencing what you are and you’re surrounded by peers, upperclassmen, and staff that will help you if you ask!</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to make new friends. High school is your “fresh start”. Go in with a good attitude, turn things in, get involved, and make memories with the people around you.</li>
<li>Get involved. It helps the year go by faster and helps your high school years seem like more than just books and work.</li>
<li>Voice any questions you have to other students or staff. Questions are there to be answered, and that’s the point of school: to gain the information you need.</li>
<li>Do your homework. It might seem like busy work, but it actually helps you retain the information.</li>
<li>Procrastinating. As great as it sounds to sit back and watch Netflix rather than doing your homework, it’s better to get things done early rather than waiting till the last minute to get it done.</li>
<li>Get to class. Or rather, don’t stand in the middle of the halls and take up space to talk to your friends. If you have to do that move to the side so people can get around you.</li>
<li>Watch the attitude, this is something that ties in with respect. You might think you’re top-dog, but you’re not, and it’s important to watch what you say. You might think you’re all-that-and-a-bag-of-chips, but, once again, you’re not. It really pays off to take a breather and respect the person you’re talking to.</li>
<li>Remember you’re all in the same boat, everyone has been. Popularity isn’t important, so don’t worry about how you look in the eyes of others. Be confident and get things done.</li>
<li>Don’t sweat it. If you’re having a rough time or getting stressed, take a breather. Go off and play a game for 30 minutes, rant to your best friend, read a book&#8211; do something that helps you relax and then reevaluate the problem.<br />
That essay’s important, but so is your mental and physical health!</li>
<li>Get involved! Attend assemblies, show your pride, be happy to be a grizzly. It makes the school a far better place.</li>
<li>Read the paper, keep up online, and follow our Twitter. It’s quality stuff, and one of the most important things in the school, obviously.</li>
</ol>
