										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes a “good” teacher, or principal, or as a general statement someone who calls the shots is an open question. Some would consider a good authorizer one who doesn’t give much work while others would tend to consider one a good authorizer if they had them on their feet 24/7 and always had work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hard work makes anybody a great candidate for any profession. When a teacher works hard to get you quality material that makes them a good teacher,” freshman Mia More said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More said she believes that the main thing that makes a good teacher is their attitude and their push for motivation.&nbsp; While some new teachers,&nbsp; may tend to struggle with this, most are able to take the time to get to know their students well enough to understand what kind of workload the students can handle. However, when a teacher takes that extra mile to make sure you understand the material, that makes them outstanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A teacher that is willing to adapt to modern-day, even if they have been there for 20 years, shows that they’re willing to make the change for the better well being of the students,” freshman Elayne Logan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logan said she believes she would rather have a teacher talk about what&#8217;s in now rather than a teacher who sticks to the &#8220;old fashion&#8221; way of teaching, which doesn&#8217;t really work nowadays. Logan said that because most teachers have a stuck mindset on how teaching can be, they close themselves off to improvement and that’s what stops them from being a good teacher because they’re not willing to improve how they teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most teachers don&#8217;t really care if you actually understand, some are just trying to make it to payday. The ones who choose to stick around for so long are proven to be a good teacher,”&nbsp; More said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to differentiate between the teachers who actually teach because they want their students to learn and the teachers who teach because they’re just there for the money, More said. According to More, when you find a teacher who is genuinely concerned if you are managing the workload given, that makes them a great teacher.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each and every person has their own views on what can be considered “good” in this world but it’s your job to be able to identify why the specific thing you’re leaning toward would be considered to be a “good” thing or position.<a href="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060.jpg"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-medium wp-image-7206" src="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="317" srcset="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg 475w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-122x80.jpg 122w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-120x80.jpg 120w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060.jpg 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></a></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has been living in America for four months. Speaking two languages, Senior Kanako Daicho has the opportunity to explore and live in the United States. She studies American culture, adding the knowledge she gained from past visits to Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daicho decided to become a foreign exchange student in order to feel more independent. In Japan she always had to rely on her family, but by living abroad she is independent and connects with other people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Junior Alyssa Blumanhourst is the “sister” she lives with while she’s in America, and she also has three other siblings that come and visit Kanako and Alyssa once a month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I bond with Alyssa more because we are the same age and we have three classes together: Concert Choir, US History and Algebra 2. She helps me a lot when I’m struggling,” Daicho said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the classes to the culture, Daicho has noticed many differences in America and and Japan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Japan there are a lot of mountains. Also, it&#8217;s different from America, because Japanese walk a lot since everything is very close. In America they need cars to get to a lot of places.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At school in Japan, the teachers had their own room. Students stayed in one class while the teachers rotated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daicho said she finds American students to be more outgoing than their Japanese counterparts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Americans are more friendly and talkative to strangers and us Japanese are humble, quiet and modest,” Daicho said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Japan her favorite activity is being in an art club . The members of her art club visit places such as the art museum, where they draw and paint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We prepare for our school festival once a year. People come and examine the art and we invite guests to let them experience our art,” Daicho said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At her home school’s festival, kids get together and celebrate their culture. In America she loved that she was involved with “Hairspray”, she was even backstage painting the set. Daicho says her experiences in the United States have had a definite impact on her character.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have changed from living in America by becoming stronger and independent. I have to pay attention to my host family so I don’t trouble them,” Daicho said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future she sees herself coming back to America to visit her friends and her host family. She will return to Japan on June 28.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unique culture, interesting laws, difference in food and language, makes other countries much more fascinating than the United States to most people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many places you see in books and read in stories that &nbsp;you have to see with your eyes to really appreciate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler Grommesh, a senior, talks about the three different countries he has visited in Europe with a group from school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cities we stayed in and the countries we visited included Dublin, Ireland, London, England and Paris, France.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tyler explained his favorite part of the was how rich each culture was and their overall diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many places to visit, but Tyler picked out his favorite sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My favorite bit would have to be the drive through the Welsh countryside. The views of the mountains and the sea were just the most spectacular thing you would ever see.” Grommesh said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is such a great opportunity to go outside the country, according to Tyler Grommesh, “You are always told that these places are out there and [that] they have harbored human civilization for a millennial,” said Grommesh. He was astounded about seeing these places in person verses in the pages of a text book. Seeing these attractions and stepping onto new soil for the first time made everything feel surreal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the more interesting landmarks and places he has visited include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Book of Kells in Ireland, the Welsh Castle, Tower Bridge and Buckingham Palace in London, Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was, inevitably, some flaws in the trip, “I don’t think I would go back to France simply because of how dangerous, dirty, and cramped it was,” said Grommesh. He shared a story about how a girl was forced to pay for something that the vender forcefully put on her arm. They were even warned about people who would pickpocket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on Tyler Grommesh’s comments no matter the flaws it is crucial to visit different countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t honestly recommend going out of the country enough,” said Grommesh. “Even if you don’t think you can afford it, you should try to visit other countries especially in Europe at some point in your life.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol>
<li>Respect authority, rules, peers, and staff. You’re only at school for seven hours, you can do it, promise.</li>
<li>Taking lots of notes helps out in the end. Even with how annoying and boring it is taking lots of notes, it makes it easier to study, especially for finals.</li>
<li>Remember, you aren&#8217;t alone. There are hundreds of teens experiencing what you are and you’re surrounded by peers, upperclassmen, and staff that will help you if you ask!</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to make new friends. High school is your “fresh start”. Go in with a good attitude, turn things in, get involved, and make memories with the people around you.</li>
<li>Get involved. It helps the year go by faster and helps your high school years seem like more than just books and work.</li>
<li>Voice any questions you have to other students or staff. Questions are there to be answered, and that’s the point of school: to gain the information you need.</li>
<li>Do your homework. It might seem like busy work, but it actually helps you retain the information.</li>
<li>Procrastinating. As great as it sounds to sit back and watch Netflix rather than doing your homework, it’s better to get things done early rather than waiting till the last minute to get it done.</li>
<li>Get to class. Or rather, don’t stand in the middle of the halls and take up space to talk to your friends. If you have to do that move to the side so people can get around you.</li>
<li>Watch the attitude, this is something that ties in with respect. You might think you’re top-dog, but you’re not, and it’s important to watch what you say. You might think you’re all-that-and-a-bag-of-chips, but, once again, you’re not. It really pays off to take a breather and respect the person you’re talking to.</li>
<li>Remember you’re all in the same boat, everyone has been. Popularity isn’t important, so don’t worry about how you look in the eyes of others. Be confident and get things done.</li>
<li>Don’t sweat it. If you’re having a rough time or getting stressed, take a breather. Go off and play a game for 30 minutes, rant to your best friend, read a book&#8211; do something that helps you relax and then reevaluate the problem.<br />
That essay’s important, but so is your mental and physical health!</li>
<li>Get involved! Attend assemblies, show your pride, be happy to be a grizzly. It makes the school a far better place.</li>
<li>Read the paper, keep up online, and follow our Twitter. It’s quality stuff, and one of the most important things in the school, obviously.</li>
</ol>
