										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With&nbsp; Christmas right around the corner Amazon has been really busy with people buying gifts. Amazon has list of popular gift ideas for different ages. These list have been really helpful for kids who don’t know what they want and for people who don’t know what to buy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be difficult to buy Christmas gifts for children who are newborns to 2 years old. Things that amazon has to offer for newborn children are books some that are normal and ones that talk, onesies, baby toys, and baby tooth brushes. For kids who are older there are bigger toys on the website. They offer kids appliances like washers, fridges, and ovens that young kids would sure enjoy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids who are 3-5 years old start to get into more character toys. Amazon offers many different character toys that young children would enjoy. They have Paw patrol, super heroes and baby yoda. They also offer LOL, Barbie, and baby shark. They also have non character things like play doh, coloring activities , and stuffed animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For children 6-8 amazon offers a little more advanced toys and activities. They offer more complex Lego city, Lego friends, Lego avengers, and Lego Minecraft sets. They also offer S.T.E.M sets, jewelry sets, and art sets. There is also a couple popular board games like mousetrap, clue, and chutes &amp; ladders on the site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids who are 9-11 are in the weird faze where they aren’t little kids but not teens yet. Amazon offers many different toys that would fit their ages and interests. They offer many things for artistic kids like spirograph, 3D coloring puzzles, blank comic books, how to draw books, water color painting, and rock painting sets. For the kids who like more hands on things they have slime kits, rubix cubes, Legos, chemistry sets, break open geodes, and origami. For the kids who like games they have chess, sorry, Tetris, lightning reload shocking game, dabble, and monopoly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teens are in the time where they don’t really play with toys so it’s harder to shop for them. Amazon offers many different electronics and add ons for the electronics. They sell Nintendo switches, just dance, Mario cart, controllers, smart watches, tablets, speakers, echo dots, and TV’s. They have board/card games like exploding kittens, what do you meme?, giant checkers, giant connect 4, and stranger things eggo card game. They also have other things like snack boxes, ring lights, clothing, picture printers, art sets, and guitars.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon offers many gift ideas to help anyone out with shopping.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>In early November the United States became the first nation to see more than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases reported in a single day.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&nbsp; wide variety of people who don&#8217;t get symptoms make being out in public potentially dangerous for people With the holidays approaching, people have the urge to travel and visit family. The White House throughout the pandemic has continued to downplay the threat so people worry less, leading to numbers rising.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important Facts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers say the pandemic is responsible for roughly 1,000 fatalities per day, six times the average daily toll from the worst influenza season in the past decade</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s known that 20% to 40% of those infected are thought to be asymptomatic – they never exhibit any symptoms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel by bussing is something to avoid, they are considered high risk and are COVID transmission hot spots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking to travel, going by plane is the safest route. Planes have turbo-charged ventilation systems. Cars are also safer and an alternative when visiting people for Christmas and New Years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of personal protective equipment remains a chronic problem, especially in hot spots for the virus</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel is risky and unsafe right now but when looking for an option to get from place to place airplanes are the safest option for public transportation. Planes have a system installed to prevent recycled air from entering the cabin and potentially exposing others to the virus.&nbsp; Several airlines also instilled strict mask-wearing mandates and some require temperature checks and negative COVID test results before allowing passengers to board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the ending of November is when Kansas got hit the worst with a total of 7,497 confirmed cases. This was confirmed on November 23. As of December, the reports of positive tests have been in the 4,000s in the area. The reason for explaining the COVID-19 scores isn&#8217;t to scare people; it is simply to spread awareness of the current crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is key to note that America’s 60 million rural residents are older. Many of these older members of the community are diagnosed with chronic health problems at higher rates than the national average. It is important to understand that these older people are considered more at risk from the virus. Getting a COVID test to make sure you are negative before seeing people will end up being the best bet for keeping yourself and other people safe. False negatives are common though, and it&#8217;s no guarantee that you or anyone you know that might be traveling aren&#8217;t contagious. No matter what precautions you take a large number of gatherings have turned into spreader events because people who tested assumed it was safe to be in a large group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about other people and not just yourself is something that has the possibility to be life-saving. </span></p>
