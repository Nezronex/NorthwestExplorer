										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses also offer diversity and innovation to our community, economy, as well as being able to generate a variety of products which has a huge impact. It’s not as popular to hear as much talk about small businesses in financial news, but according to the Small Business Administration, 54 percent of U.S. sales come from small businesses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since some small businesses have stepped up and closed their doors to try and help prevent the spread of COVID 19 in the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Steps Which Include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switching to carryout-only for some restaurants&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the tough decision to temporarily close</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online shopping only</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stopping sales at farmers markets to halt the possibility of getting exposed&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the cautious decision to close your doors to the public is most of the time a difficult decision to make. Over time the community created from these small businesses becomes like a family and letting that go isn’t easy. &#8216;</span></p>
