										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The orchestra had its last concert of the 2022-23 school year, Tuesday, May 16th, which was a perfect goodbye for the seniors. Compared to the school’s band, the orchestra is not as visible, given that they don’t perform during pep rallies or sporting events. During this concert they had three sections; the Sinfonietta Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, and Concert Orchestra.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sinfonietta section was titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruisin’ Around the World,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and they played Adventure on the High Seas, Lijiang River Landscape, Ye Bonnie Banks ‘n’ Braes, and Caribbean Cruise. The Chamber section was titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Takes Two Bears to Tango, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and they played La Bamba, Manhā de Carnaval, and Por Una Cabeza. Lastly, the Concert section was titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seniors on Broadway </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and they did a mashup of a few songs from these three musicals, Mamma Mia with solos from Ruth Arrasmith, Isabella Straight, and Elexis Williams, Beauty and the Beast with solos from Carolina Contreras, Renee Amaya, Lizbeth Diaz, and Ruth West, and then Hamilton with solos from Sophia Anderson, Kristina Guitierrez, Luis Piedra, and Brayden Hoang.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the last section of the concert the director, Madeline Crawford gave some awards, these included letters, certificates, and cords for the seniors, and then she awarded two students for showing great amounts of leadership. Isabella Straight got the National School Orchestra Award, voted by her fellow classmates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt shocked because even though I have been a concertmaster for five years I’m not always the nicest person,” said Straight (12).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The next one was Director’s Choice Award and it went to Elexis Williams, as the name suggests this was chosen by their director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was grateful and excited that my work during the year was being recognized,” said Williams (12).</span></p>
