										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Journalism students found out Tuesday that they placed 2nd in the Kansas State Fair’s Scholastic Press Corps competition held Sept. 11 in Hutchinson.</p>
<p>Eighteen teams competed in the contest. Northwest’s print team won $50 for being the Reserve Grand Champion.</p>
<p>When the group arrived at the fair around 8 a.m, they set up their equipment and were given until 6 p.m. to make the four page newsletter. The newsletter, named the “Meadowlark Messenger” contained four stories and photos covering activities and attractions at the fair.</p>
<p>“It was intense and down to the wire, but I still had fun,” junior Emily Dulohery said.</p>
<p>Every moment was used to interview, take photos,and design the newsletter.</p>
<p>”The room got a little chaotic towards the end, but I know that they gave it their all; blood, sweat, and tears were put into our publication,” journalism teacher Rebekah Morse said.</p>
<p>The newsletter consisted of topics including a bedazzled bra contest, chicken baths, a talking robot and the dare devil high dive.</p>
<p>Judges rated the publications on design, content, and photography.</p>
<p>“It was 5:59, and the deadline was 6 p.m., so we saved everything to the flashdrive and I had to sprint to the judge’s table to make it in time,” senior Cody Kretchmar said.</p>
<p>In addition to Dulohery and Kretchmar, print team members included seniors Taylor Allen and Madison McCollum.</p>
<p>Video team members included juniors Mira Smith, Tatum Sturdivant, Grace Wilkinson, senior Jozabeth Garcia and sophomore Jordan Coss.</p>
