										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases when people sign up for things, they expect them to be easy and simple and that is because of society glamorizing and only showing what people want to see. Advertisers may show the good and don’t think to mention the challenges of these activities till it’s too late, so the people watching or listening play into the challenges that it has with what’s being advertised.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some activities that may take more effort than students expect include AVID, ECA, theatre groups, book clubs, and other extracurricular activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something to keep in mind is that everything takes work. The thing to note is how much effort you’re willing to put into something to get the desired outcome. For example, you get into a program that will help you out in the long run with college but the thing you forget is the effort it takes to stay in the program. Most times people just seem to stop and give up when things get difficult because we as adults and children are told by the people with more power or knowledge that it is okay, however is not the only reason. When it comes to school, most students seem to focus better in the actual classroom. Some students end up dropping out because they don’t see a point in what they are being told to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the students are pushing themselves to make it through school even though it’s online and may be more difficult to focus. These students show everyone in the long run that no matter how tough things get, putting in the effort is important. Students who start small and build themselves up and become leaders are the people who send positive messages to the ones that are scared to start from nothing. These people are life changers in one way or another, and that’s something important to realize. Signing up and getting accepted into something thinking it is going to be easy because that’s how it seems is the wrong mindset to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into something having the wrong mindset can easily lead to failure. High school and college students tend to drop out for multiple reasons. Some learners may feel they are too far behind academically to catch up and feel as if they don’t have their teachers by their side, while others may have problems at home. Whatever the reason, many support systems exist such as counselors, after-school groups, tutoring in-school and out of school tutoring, and teachers to help students stay in school and earn diplomas or degrees; most students just won’t reach out to those support systems to know they are there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to realize what you’re signing up for and why you are doing it whether that may be for money, an education, or just for fun. People are watching you in public when you make a bold move, you could be a life-changer too.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fall is here, but COVID concerns may limit ways to celebrate the season. However, all around Wichita there still remain countless things to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safety precaution because COVID is limiting activities makes it to where people stay safe but also have the ability to have fun and do the things people enjoy with their family. Cox farm is offering a kiddie corn maze and a pumpkin patch this year to families who are interested. On the Cox farms website, it has a countdown to when Halloween is and the website does list about their history and the main attractions such as the market that is open year-round Monday through Saturday 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. The fall festival is promoted to be a safe way to celebrate with the family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;This year the annual Wicked Island is still being hosted at OJ Watson park for a fun attraction. There are also activities such as going to Corn mazes and picking out pumpkins to carve. On the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wicked Woods </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website, it promotes and states that face masks are required. It also states that anyone who buys a ticket will be provided with a face mask and that if you don’t abide by the rules and regulations by wearing the mask you will be asked to leave. The annual escape room is not available this year for safety reasons because of COVID. The website states that all sales are final and that by purchasing a ticket you are agreeing to abide by the rules. Wicked Island is a 30-minute walk through in which you encounter ghosts and goblins and, the occasional scream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Field of Screams this year for Halloween and is another option when looking at fall activities. Field of Screams is the e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">xperience of the haunted grounds of the Spurlock family and see first-hand where the infamous vigilante murders took place. It states on the website that masks are required and that the field of screams is not recommended for young children and the events for the field of screams take place at night and are available on the weekend all through the month of October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are tons of fun activities to encounter this year even with the virus you just have to put yourself out there and be willing to make the best out of the experience.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both students and teachers are still trying to adjust to the online experience.&nbsp; A day in the life of a Northwest student starts at 8 a.m. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">except for Early College Academy program students who start at 7 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students of various grades have different perspectives and outlooks when it comes to the online experience. Students have more free time and most of the time isn’t a good thing in their eyes. Some students said they can’t focus well and get bored easily. One plus about online school according to some is it’s easier for students to stay organized. They don’t have papers all over the place to keep track of or papers they could accidentally throw away.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some experiences that students don’t get this year, but there are still many good things coming out of it. The organization is a key thing to keeping the online school experience from getting messy and out of place.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I was not very organized when I went in person so online is honestly helping me be more organized,” Gage Weaver, junior, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of different views on if going online is better or worse for the organizational skills of students. Students such as Miranda Lewis think going online for schooling this year is better for the organizational skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s honestly easier to stay organized online because I don’t have a bunch of papers to keep track of,” Miranda Lewis, sophomore, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going online has caused many students to miss out on extracurricular activities and experiences. Freshmen this year are missing out on meeting new people and growing to know their teachers better. Seniors are missing out on spending time with their friends in their last year of high school. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are some perks to staying at home, many miss being around people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I do enjoy being able to stay in bed, but I do miss being in a classroom and being able to build relationships with my teachers and classmates,” Lewis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One positive side to schools being online this year is that people have fewer chances of getting sick and students and teachers both get to experience this new way of learning together. There are still times where students are able to make fun of the situation and become friends with new people in instances where teachers put students in breakout rooms. With schools going online, it also gives students more opportunities to go in-depth with their work; they just have to be able to use their time management skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something I would highlight would definitely be those times when the class is in awkward silence. I just find that hilarious,” Ayah Gharbi, freshman, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Weaver also has mixed feelings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some highs for the classes have been learning stuff that will apply in the future with financial literacy, and a low has been math homework,” Weaver said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the reviews are mixed for remote learning, it&#8217;s likely to continue as long as the Board of Education determines it is the best way to protect students and staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Online school is something some students love and some students hate, but we have to do to stay safe,” Jaya Smith, freshman, said.</span></p>
