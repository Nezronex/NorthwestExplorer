										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Rangel, a 17-year old Juinor from Northwest high school whose weekdays are filled with school homework, working on projects, and completing them before the deadlines hit. He is persistent when it comes to keeping his grades up and making sure he has time in his schedule to keep up with his passions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rangel explains that he doesn&#8217;t stand out in a crowd although recently he dyed his hair pink which is contrasting to his statement in which he felt that he normally doesn’t stand out. Rangel has a passion for painting and other forms of art. He picked up this passion from gaining lots of free time after his mom would not let him go outsideWeekends are filled with drawing, painting, and sewing time. Those are activities that keep him relaxed and mellowed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just became something I always loved to do and I&#8217;m still learning new ways to draw forms and shade along with finding different mediums to paint with,” Rangel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sewing is something he picked up not too long ago and it’s something that he isn’t the best at but is something that he feels passionate about. Rangel plans to continue learning new patterns and stitches. Learning how to find a steadying pattern and making himself a shirt that doesn’t fall apart at the seams is a goal he has. Activities, passions, and goals are things that keep Rangel going to help motivate him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My parents have always been impressed by my finished projects and think I can really make something out of them, they always take me out when they can if I&#8217;m in need of more supplies. ” Rangel said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both students and teachers are still trying to adjust to the online experience.&nbsp; A day in the life of a Northwest student starts at 8 a.m. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">except for Early College Academy program students who start at 7 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students of various grades have different perspectives and outlooks when it comes to the online experience. Students have more free time and most of the time isn’t a good thing in their eyes. Some students said they can’t focus well and get bored easily. One plus about online school according to some is it’s easier for students to stay organized. They don’t have papers all over the place to keep track of or papers they could accidentally throw away.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some experiences that students don’t get this year, but there are still many good things coming out of it. The organization is a key thing to keeping the online school experience from getting messy and out of place.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I was not very organized when I went in person so online is honestly helping me be more organized,” Gage Weaver, junior, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of different views on if going online is better or worse for the organizational skills of students. Students such as Miranda Lewis think going online for schooling this year is better for the organizational skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s honestly easier to stay organized online because I don’t have a bunch of papers to keep track of,” Miranda Lewis, sophomore, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going online has caused many students to miss out on extracurricular activities and experiences. Freshmen this year are missing out on meeting new people and growing to know their teachers better. Seniors are missing out on spending time with their friends in their last year of high school. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are some perks to staying at home, many miss being around people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I do enjoy being able to stay in bed, but I do miss being in a classroom and being able to build relationships with my teachers and classmates,” Lewis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One positive side to schools being online this year is that people have fewer chances of getting sick and students and teachers both get to experience this new way of learning together. There are still times where students are able to make fun of the situation and become friends with new people in instances where teachers put students in breakout rooms. With schools going online, it also gives students more opportunities to go in-depth with their work; they just have to be able to use their time management skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something I would highlight would definitely be those times when the class is in awkward silence. I just find that hilarious,” Ayah Gharbi, freshman, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Weaver also has mixed feelings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some highs for the classes have been learning stuff that will apply in the future with financial literacy, and a low has been math homework,” Weaver said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the reviews are mixed for remote learning, it&#8217;s likely to continue as long as the Board of Education determines it is the best way to protect students and staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Online school is something some students love and some students hate, but we have to do to stay safe,” Jaya Smith, freshman, said.</span></p>
