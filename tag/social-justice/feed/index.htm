										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Following in the footsteps of Kansas and Arizona, Mississippi now plans to legalize discrimination.</p>
<p>Lately businesses and employees want ‘the right’ to refuse service to openly queer individuals simply on religious grounds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They say this is like Muslim employees having the right to not handle beef, when in reality it’s more like a Jewish employee not doing their job just because a person walked in with a hotdog shirt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When faced with any criticism these ‘supporters’ get defensive, even trying to play the completely made up ‘reverse discrimination’ card.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I say completely fake because it is. In no way can oppressive people be oppressed. They hold no political/social power because these are held by oppressors. They’re being called out on their behavior and they can’t take it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the words of this online commenter on this article: “Christians especially need special protection under the law now. They are being threatened with prison and bankruptcy for not supporting homosexual events when ordered to do so by homosexuals. Time to put Christians under civil rights protection,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">So somehow not being legally protected to harass someone is now a punishable offence in their eyes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The threat of bankruptcy comes from the ‘Christian’ business owner’s own problems with people, not the other way around.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I don’t understand how the queer identity of someone else could have such a negative effect on someone that they feel the need to legally take away their feeling of security in places of business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People claim that they do this in the name of their religion, but in reality, they’re just being selfish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The idea that women are equal in society is completely false. Women with the same qualities as men are often seen as rude and pushy and hormonal instead of being a leader or in charge as men are expected to be.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the day you’re born you are started on a set of traits based on physical traits. Fat becomes an insult, something commonly used against girls like me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your personality is open to criticism if it dares to show itself. Any ideas can be devalued immediately because of who you are. On several occasions I’ve been devalued online and in person for my opinions just because I’m female.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To this day women are limited in their personalities and role in society. Women are still told what to do by others because sexism and bigotry are still prevalent today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Women are told how to look by the media, given unrealistic expectations of beauty and are harassed if they are too big or small or short or tall or if their face doesn’t follow the same symmetry as another woman.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Women are constantly subjected to be in comparison of other women their whole lives. But what is the point of being beautiful? So you will appeal more to men, because that determines your worth apparently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Being locked into place by societal standards is all too much for young women, leading to unhealthy thinking and thoughts that they aren’t worth anything just because society said they weren’t.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They are told their place and expected to stay there, like a trained animal instead of a human being. Self-respect is definitely the determining factor of who you are, not what society tells you to be.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ambition shouldn’t be stifled due to being called “selfish.” Having a family should be your choice. How you dress should be your choice. What and who you like are entirely up to you, and shouldn’t be criticized by anyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every time I’ve told someone that I don’t plan on getting married or having children, they tell me “you’ll change your mind” even though I really don’t want kids. I don’t want a child to care for but that doesn’t make me selfish, that just means I have a different plan in life than what other people have seemingly decided for me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t tell me sexism doesn’t exist just because I can vote. Sexism won’t exist when I can express ideas and make my own choices without being talked down to or asked if I’m on my period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard someone (white) say; “You aren’t (insert race here,) you’re just a person to me! I don’t see race!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">I can’t help but cringe when I hear that, not because I don’t think they’re a person, but because I do see their race.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Society has developed a way to circumvent races through eliminating POC from their color spectrum, and just pretending to see white.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I know it isn’t supposed to be meant that way, but the habit of thinking is definitely not a step forward.</p>
<p>Whenever someone tells me they’re racially colorblind, what they’re really telling me is that they’ve been told to not judge others by the color of their skin so much that they’ve completely minimized that aspect of a human being’s identity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Different cultures deserve representation in society, a persons skin is still a part of them and shouldn’t be an uncomfortable topic because it’s different than the usual mix of European countries.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s the point most people miss because they try to ignore skin color.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My mother is often mistaken for a multitude of races, and her dad was an immigrant from an unknown country so she identifies as white, but a lot of people just make assumptions because they’re afraid to ask, usually lying somewhere in Mexico when the truth is far more interesting and unique to her.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve never met someone who didn’t have something interesting to tell me about where their roots lie, most were glad I actually ask questions rather than skirt around an important part of them.</p>
