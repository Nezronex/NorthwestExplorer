										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest’s wrestling team has been accomplishing all they set out for so far this season. The team is 5-0 in the City League. “We have eight kids ranked for state already, so I’d say that we’re doing well,” wrestling coach Eric Prichard said. The team has won every tournament they have been to so far including Wellington, Pratt, and Bishop Carrol. “The team is right where I want them to be right now,” Prichard said. Northwest is going for their 3rd straight City League championship. “I really want us to go for a three-peat, I don’t think its been done before yet,” Prichard said. The wrestlers most recently had a 49-18 win against Heights on Wednesday, Jan. 29. “I’m looking forward to finishing the year strong, and really hoping for a top three finish at state this year,” Prichard said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Northwest girls won their first game 53-33 against North on Dec. 6, and demolished West in their second game  with a 67-21 score on Dec. 10.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s always a great experience,” sophomore Shaunece Grant said on her first year playing with the varsity team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The girls have started off great so far and are improving in their practices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So far as a team we have gotten better each game, so I hope that continues,” Grant said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve been turning the ball over a lot so we have been focusing on keeping the ball in practice, I think our hard work will pay off in our next game against South,” sophomore Haley Cooper said.</p>
<p>Their next game is on Tuesday, Dec. 17 at home against South.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>September 16 the JV soccer team played against Derby V. The game started with confusion, “where is Coach Rooney? He is never late.”</p>
<p>Ten minutes after the team was suppose to meet coach Rooney ran across the field and quickly gathered his players in a circle. Then captain junior David Luico asked coach if he had a good day, the reply was clear “I’m pretty good, I just had a baby.”</p>
<p>Coach Rooney had to leave shortly after his arrival. Coach Bribiesca lead the team in the first half and Coach Shook took over in second. Neither Bribiesca nor Shook could coach them through warm-up so the team had to warm up on their own and attempt to stay focused the whole time.</p>
<p>Captains David Luico and Austin Haase, both juniors, had to take some extra responsibility.</p>
<p>“We had to take charge during warm-up,” Haase said, “We completely respect Rooney,” Juico adds. The two captains decided that the game was dedicated to Rooney’s son, JP.</p>
