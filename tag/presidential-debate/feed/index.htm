										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first 2020 presidential campaign kicked off with a fiery debate this past Tuesday between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. With both candidates giving two minute answers to questions about Covid-19, police brutality and mass incarceration, it gave voters a lot to consider.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with multiple positive comments about health care and controlling the Coronavirus, came a lot of controversy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Biden calling Trump “un-presidential” and a “clown”, and Trump firing back with “I’ve done more in 47 months than you have in 47 years” and arguing with the moderator, it was a wild ride from start to finish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some students think that the debate showed that Trump was not presidential material.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump’s not really a politician,” Lenna Roberts stated. “We basically elected a businessman to be our president.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While another student said she felt like Trump was not forthcoming with his answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raena Ford said, “He’s a question dodger. He always changes the subject.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This over two hour long debate was monitored by journalist and news anchor Chris Wallace. He was asked about his opinion on the debate and he was not pleased.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never dreamt that it would go off the tracks the way that it did,” Wallace said.</span></p>
