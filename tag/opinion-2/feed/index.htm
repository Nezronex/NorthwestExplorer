										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of media attention upon race issues have sprung up within the years of 2015-2016. Great controversy has risen with the Sandra Bland case, the Baltimore riots, police brutality, and the heated debate of “Black lives matter” against “All lives matter”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phrase “‘Black lives matter’ is mirrored, distorted, refuted and mocked by the phrase ‘All lives matter’”, as said in an article published by </span><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/23/all-lives-matter-racist-trump-weekend-campaign-rally-proved-it"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in November 2015. The original phrase was introduced to society in 2013 after 28-year-old neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman was found not guilty for the death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in a gated housing community in Florida. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article also explains how the controversy of the two phrases caused violence at the Donald Trump rally in Alabama with a black protester being beaten and dragged from the rally due to chanting ‘All black lives matter’ to the ‘All lives matter’ participants of the rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But all of these issues seem to be involving African Americans only. Before the remarks that Donald Trump made about Mexicans, no one seemed to be interested about the racist issues within the Hispanic community. All black lives do matter, but what about all latino lives? In 2014, Salinas, Calif.  was in unrest after protesters accused police of racism in the fatal shooting of three Latino men, then in May after another Latino man was shot to death outside his home, as reported on </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/us/california-protest-police-shooting-hispanics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Four days before Halloween in 2015, the police shot and killed unarmed Oscar Jr., a 28 year old Hispanic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither the media or society seem to care about the stereotypes, racial slurs, and police brutality inflicted upon the hispanic community.  A </span><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-0718-latino-police-20150718-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article written in July of last year state that, “The muted reaction towards to the deaths of latinos in confrontations with the police tells a larger story: Black Lives Matter is starkly different from Brown Lives Matter….In contrast to the fatal shootings of African Americans…. Deaths of latinos at the hand of law enforcement haven&#8217;t drawn as nearly as much attention.” The majority of people can tell you who Sandra Bland is but not who Antonio Zambrano-Montes is; an unarmed immigrant who was shot and killed by the police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racism has always existed, and always will. But as a nation, we should be working together to decrease racism not with just one race, but with all races. My thoughts and opinions cannot be more well said as how Raul Reyes said in his article </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/opinions/reyes-antonio-zambrano-montes/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doesn’t life of Latino shot by police matter?</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until we know the real statistics, how can we expect real outrage? Latinos bear our own share of responsibility for not putting greater value on Latino lives.”</span></p>
<p><b>Holding Cells</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hispanics are often attacked with racism due to their skin color, culture, or ‘immigration background’.  They are also outright prejudiced against due to the stereotype of an immigrant who is stealing American jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of immigrants in the United States is and could become a huge problem with 11, 714,500 immigrants residing in America. But the way deported immigrants are treated should improve. During the process of deportation, immigrants are sent to holding cells. Each year, the cells hold thousands of people near the southern border that are often reported as extremely cold, overcrowded, and usually lacking in adequate food, water, and medical care. These holding cells were originally meant to detain a person for less than 12 hours, but over 80 percent of people detained are there for over 24 hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 80 percent includes men, women, and children. Children are forced to sleep on concrete floors or on hard benches within the holding cells that replace the lack of beds. Statistics show that nearly 8,000 people were held in the concrete cells for three days or longer, while another 25,000 were held for 48 hours or longer. “Immigrants were denied water, and when they did get it, it was almost undrinkable,&#8221; said Ray Stern in his article </span><a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/immigrants-caught-at-border-mistreated-in-holding-cells-lawsuit-says-7401983"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrants caught at border mistreated in holding cells, Lawsuit says.</span></i></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if its is for short period of time, living under such unsanitary and uncomfortable conditions can affect a person mentally. Such conditions can be compared to those of a prison. The majority of immigrants are going through a major change in their lives physically, mentally, and spiritually. They are searching for a way to change their lives for the better. And to be treated as a prisoner is outright humiliating. Conditions of these detention facilities should improve for the case of the families and children who are being deported. People should not be treated in such way especially if they have done nothing wrong. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I drive down 21st Street for the thousandth time I see something different, an emergency vehicle that says “Emergency Donut Vehicle” right in front of an up and coming donut shop. I will admit I was really excited to know that there is finally a donut shop on the west side. And what I predict to be a really cool hangout place. </span></p>
<p>As I went in I immediately felt the vibe of relaxation hit me. The lights were dark and there were tables and chairs everywhere. It had a bit of a hipster vibe and reminded me of the Donut Whole downtown. Once I took in the scenery I noticed the line was long with people anxiously waiting for their donuts.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my time was slowly approaching, I observed the wide array of donuts Hurts had to offer. From  simple glazed donuts to more complicated ones like Andes Mint donuts and more. And the best part is they are really inexpensive, the glazed ones are $1 a piece and the more complicated ones are $3 at the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my time came I got the Cookies and Cream one and it was truly amazing, who knew that Cookies and Cream and donuts would be such a good combination? Since I first went I have gone two more times and I can promise that those two times are not the last times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would recommend this place to anyone who loves donuts and who is looking for a cool place to hang out after school or on the weekends. So if you’re craving something after school or just for a quick snack, Hurts Donuts is the place to go.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems when someone wants to be rude, they cite the first amendment, as if it gives them an excuse to stomp on any objections. Because it’s “just their opinion.”<br />
The amendment reads as such: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”</p>
<p>When broken down, there is nothing that says “harass people with whatever you want, without any repercussions.”</p>
<p>When the journalists at Charlie Hebdo were shot, thousands rallied behind this ‘satirical’ magazine, saying the attack was on free speech.<br />
When Michael Brown was shot, and when Treyvon Martin was shot, everyone blamed the victim for bringing it upon themselves, and it was downright wrong.<br />
The protests trying to spread correct information then were swept under the rug, deemed unnecessary because people thought they were hearing the full story. People both stating opinions and facts were in a war with police officers who were there to serve and protect. Free speech though, right?</p>
<p>Yet over in France, everyone sided with the one harassing people who, admittedly, face a lot of discrimination already, France does not allow hijabs or similar cultural headdresses to be worn in public, making it punishable by law for observing their own culture.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not saying the taking of a life is ever justified, but the massive reaction siding with a hate-fueled magazine was completely unjustified. </p>
<p>When a mass shooting of schoolchildren or innocent bystanders is perpetrated by a young white man, he is ‘troubled’ or ‘mentally ill.’ But if the race and religion were anything else, the killer would be torn apart by the media, and an immediate backlash would occur against the religion/race of that individual, exhibited by the Charlie Hebdo situation.</p>
<p>I may sound like a broken record, but honestly so does the news, nothing is getting fixed. It’s tiring to hear over and over.</p>
<p>And it is the Charlie Hebdo mentality that is to blame. This shock humor made to offend, past its annoying, 7th grade-esque face value, is really about maintaining a sort of system, a status quo left unrealized. And I think we can do so much better than that.</p>
<p>Things can only get better, hopefully, little by little. There will always be people wary of injustices, and we should know we can do better, and be better. We deserve better. Until America achieves that ominous “liberty and justice for all.” Why only focus on the First Amendment?</p>
<p>But hey, this is just my opinion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Headaches, sleep loss, and the overwhelming urge to cry: these are all lovely signs of being stressed. It’s now December and the clock is ticking, wrapping up yet another year. Only one semester left after Christmas break for us seniors and my drive to do anything is at a negative seventy-five. It’s the time where we get questioned on a daily basis where we want to go to college and what we want to study. The only answer I can seem to formulate to these questions though, is that I have absolutely no idea.<br />
After being told what to do or where to go for 17 years, I am now expected to just make a life changing decision before I even turn 18. For some, the decision is easy but for others like me, it’s not. I’m horrible at making decisions, I can’t even decide what I want for dinner every night let alone what I want to do for the next four years.<br />
The clock on senior year keeps ticking and as it does, senioritis just gets worse. All I want to do is graduate and get out of here, but with all the tasks needing to be done, a part of me wants the clock to tick a bit slower.<br />
If someone had asked me where I wanted to go a few weeks ago I would have a clear cut answer, but one thought about money and I’m back to square one.<br />
Maybe I’ll just wing it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, study, or by being taught. Does that sound familiar? Welcome to the actual definition of learning. Experience, study, being taught&#8211; there is no “memorization to regurgitation” in the definition of learning, so why is that the go-to for our education system? </p>
<p>Students are constantly tested, pulling all nighters, and try to fit into the criteria given to them by their teachers, all in an attempt for the best grade. We follow those motions, the “muscle memory” of students past, but we aren’t actually thinking or learning things to use later in life. We aren’t building up portfolios, we aren’t gaining real life experience, we don’t know how to jump a car, change a tire, or sew a button&#8211; some people don’t know cooking outside of a grilled cheese. These are, of course, “elective courses” we can take throughout our high school career, but that’s the point. Elective courses aren’t important, or at least not seen as such. It doesn’t matter if you can sew your button back on your pants, it just matters if you know the order of the 43 presidents and which one can not tell a lie. </p>
<p>The biggest problem is that teachers aren’t allowed to let us explore our options, they’re not allowed to teach us anything but a paradigm way of thinking, we’re not learning how to truly problem solve. They are not allowed to let us do things that and expand our horizons, but how could they? Our teachers are tested on their ability to teach by standardized tests and we, the students, are tested by our ability to memorize a book, the basics of the essay, and most importantly, how to please the supervisors for the best grade. </p>
<p>The response to this isn’t “that’s how it works. That’s what we do.”, no, the response should always be what’s the problem. We’re told that everything can be changed for the better, that things can always be adjusted to make life better. So why is it that artificial, meaningless-to-real-world tests and grades are the way we think we prepare students? Why is this the way that the self-worth of a student is determined? </p>
<p>College is the biggest ‘jump to’ for schools when defending their current system. Colleges give finals, they say. Students need to be able to pass tests, they claim. The problem with this system isn’t that we haven’t been taking finals, that isn’t why students are having trouble in our universities. </p>
<p>Northwest pushes for AP enrollment, for their students to apply themselves and attempt to take this big test filled with information, or to take concurrent credit, and attempt to gain it before entering college. However, why should we try to do that, when we’ve finally learned how to work the corrupt system?  College courses require you to apply previous knowledge to develop your own theories, they require you to think above your current level of knowledge, and write an essay paper, or to attempt to develop a cure to cancer in the lab. These are things we should be learning to do, these are things we should be required to learn. In high school it’s all about making sure you have a 4.0, an A in every class possible, and are involved enough in school to look good on a college application. We don’t need to know how to apply ourselves, to ask questions for extra knowledge. We just need to know how to pick out the facts from our teachers and apply them to our multiple choice tests. </p>
<p>Our future education is hard, because we don’t know how to think for ourselves. Our ability to function outside of our homes is crippled. We don’t learn, we absorb and memorize. </p>
<p>A busted tire is not fixed by our hands. It’s fixed by a parent, or mechanic, as we calm our hearts on the side of the road. A busted button on pants is not fixed by a quick motion of needle and thread, but instead brought together by a safety pin, and then tossed into the trash. Diabetes is something unsolvable, an enigma with scientific reasoning that can not be cured. It’s not something we think to solve, to try and fix, because we can not see a way to fix it. We do not develop real life experience. We do not develop real life skills. We do not develop critical thinking. </p>
<p>We do not learn how to problem solve. We learn how to write, read, copy, and repeat. We are tested on our ability to spit out facts, to compose a sentence perfectly, and please the administration. </p>
<p>We are asked to write an essay with a paintbrush. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The first amendment, one of the most important building blocks of the foundation of the United States. It sickens me that it always seems to be under attack.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As citizens, the First Amendment guarantees us the right of freedom of speech, press, religion, petition and assembly. We can print what we want to print, say what we want to say, worship who we feel we should, gather in groups and write angry letters to the government if we want to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I firmly agree with these rights, which is what makes me furious every time I see the first amendment being ignored, deliberately misinterpreted, and altogether broken on both the local and federal level. The freedom of speech seems to be one of the rights that are violated with frightening frequency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">French enlightenment writer Voltaire once said that, “I do not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” More and more, instead of defending our right to say what we want to, the government’s attitude has been more along the lines of, “Say what you want, but only if we agree with it.”  Courts and school boards have been ruling more and more in the favor of squelching anyone, everyone and anything that doesn’t support Obama’s administration and or a liberal agenda.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reporter’s houses have been raided and notes pertaining to articles that would not be favorable to the government were confisticated; Harvard ( a very liberal college) is putting out students who actually believe and have stated in their papers that that the first amendment should be repealed, “because free speech threatens liberalism.” In California, a student with pro-life posters was assaulted by a staff member after refusing to take down their posters and quoting the campus free-speech policy. The student then had their posters ripped up, shoved multiple times against a wall, and shoved out of an elevator.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The problem is, people don’t seem to know how to use the freedom of speech. Some people have the mistaken belief that free speech also gives you protection of your opinion. No. You have the right to say anything you want, but every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and putting your opinion out there makes you free game to be disagreed with. If are disagreed with, then discuss differences-something we should have a right to. The founding fathers gave us the right to discuss our differences freely, and unfortunately, we have thrown that right into the trash in favor of shutting people down.</p>
<p>Our principles as a nation have been under attack, and we need to stop ourselves from sliding into a nation that is a cruel mockery of what we are supposed to be. Go ahead and disagree with me, go ahead and tell me, you have the right to do so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The idea that women are equal in society is completely false. Women with the same qualities as men are often seen as rude and pushy and hormonal instead of being a leader or in charge as men are expected to be.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the day you’re born you are started on a set of traits based on physical traits. Fat becomes an insult, something commonly used against girls like me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your personality is open to criticism if it dares to show itself. Any ideas can be devalued immediately because of who you are. On several occasions I’ve been devalued online and in person for my opinions just because I’m female.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To this day women are limited in their personalities and role in society. Women are still told what to do by others because sexism and bigotry are still prevalent today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Women are told how to look by the media, given unrealistic expectations of beauty and are harassed if they are too big or small or short or tall or if their face doesn’t follow the same symmetry as another woman.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Women are constantly subjected to be in comparison of other women their whole lives. But what is the point of being beautiful? So you will appeal more to men, because that determines your worth apparently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Being locked into place by societal standards is all too much for young women, leading to unhealthy thinking and thoughts that they aren’t worth anything just because society said they weren’t.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They are told their place and expected to stay there, like a trained animal instead of a human being. Self-respect is definitely the determining factor of who you are, not what society tells you to be.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ambition shouldn’t be stifled due to being called “selfish.” Having a family should be your choice. How you dress should be your choice. What and who you like are entirely up to you, and shouldn’t be criticized by anyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every time I’ve told someone that I don’t plan on getting married or having children, they tell me “you’ll change your mind” even though I really don’t want kids. I don’t want a child to care for but that doesn’t make me selfish, that just means I have a different plan in life than what other people have seemingly decided for me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t tell me sexism doesn’t exist just because I can vote. Sexism won’t exist when I can express ideas and make my own choices without being talked down to or asked if I’m on my period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It’s that time of year again. Time to curl up and eat the candy your mom bought for other peoples’ kids and watch movies that make you laugh, or scream depending on how well you take horror movies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are a few of my personal favorite horror classics:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084516/">Poltergeist</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I first saw this as a kid and I’ve loved it ever since. There’s something I like about a good ghost story that draws me in to this film. For those of you who haven’t seen this movie, this is the one that started the “build on an ancient burial ground” trope. An unsuspecting family moves into a house that turns out to be haunted, and they hire psychics to help cleanse it. It’s a classic and a must-see for anyone in the family.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: A few jump scares and a happy ending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also See: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">Gremlins</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Ghost Busters</a> for something more tame.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077651/">Halloween</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">What better movie to celebrate Halloween? This movie follows the dreaded killer Michael Myers and his infamous mask. And a reboot. This is one of those movies you can catch on movie channels, or at least you can catch one of the several sequels. Or the reboot. The reboot was pretty good.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: This one can get kinda gory; it’s a classic slasher film.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also See: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/?ref_=nv_sr_6">Nightmare on Elm Street</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080761/?ref_=nv_sr_3">Friday the 13th</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking of slasher films, why don’t we talk about one of the most famous horror films of all time? Friday the 13th is about Jason (yes, the hockey mask Jason, although he doesn’t wear it in this one) and his adventures in a summer camp full of teenagers. It goes as well as you would expect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: A good ol’ chainsaw slasher flick perfect for a weekend of sequels!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also See: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072271/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> if you really dig chainsaws, or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094862/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">Child’s Play</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185937/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Blair Witch Project</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The first person perspective combined with the powerful threat makes this movie a leader in  genre of found-recording thriller movies. Its ending makes it all the more terrifying, and real. It plays off the atmospheric tension to scare some, but bore others. Love it or hate it, it’s an archetype.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: Jump scares and not much gore.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also See: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179904/">Paranormal Activity</a> for more found-footage fun.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/?ref_=tt_rec_tti">The Shining</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This not only thrills you but leaves an impact. With wonderful acting that seems almost too good for Jack Nicholson to be completely sane, it left it’s mark on pop culture as well. Many scenes such as the door scene, the twins, and the infamous “redrum” writings. The novel of the same name is equally brilliant, but that is beside the point. This is a movie about a man’s descent into madness and the unseen forces behind it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: This movie leaves an impact; I always feel thrilled afterwards.</p>
<p>Also See: For more of King’s works try <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074285/">Carrie</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087050/">Children of the Corn</a>, also see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">The Ring </a>and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364385/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">The Grudge</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">I looked in the mirror and was mortified.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I returned home from the KSPA Conference in Lawrence, I wanted nothing more than a cold shower to end my long day, which started at around 4:40 a.m.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But while admiring my reflection before I stepped in my refreshing shower, I was faced with something not so refreshing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A monstrous growth was on my shoulder blade, almost resembling a mosquito bite in coloration but maybe quadruple the size.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I showed it to my mom and she said it looked like a spider bite, but I thought little of it. I jokingly tried to tap into my spidey senses, scale walls, shoot webs from my palms&#8230; All of my attempts were unsuccessful.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The next morning, I woke up with a 101.7º (F) fever. I was feeling nauseated and as I headed to the bathroom, I nearly collapsed due to dizziness. Soon enough, the swelling at the site of the bite reached from my shoulder to my waist on the whole right side of my back. Abdominal pain, headaches and shortness of breath ensued. No Spiderman capabilities yet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We went to the doctor and he told me I might have appendicitis, but I received no treatment whatsoever.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Within the next couple days, I was covered nearly from head to toe from a burning, itchy red rash. So on a second trip to the doctor, he acknowledged that I was bitten by a bug- he refused to recognize that it was a brown recluse- and I took a steroid shot and received antibiotics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since then, all of my symptoms except for a little soreness have subsided. Nonetheless, the “core” of the bite did fall out, leaving a hole in my back that you could literally stick your finger into. Luckily, skin is already growing back over it- some people undergo a much slower healing process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moral of the story? Don’t get bitten by a brown recluse. But if you do, don’t let your doctor tell you have appendicitis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spider bites are not limited to the appearance and the symptoms I described. If you experience any of the ones I listed, however, seek medical attention. The treatment really helped alleviate my discomfort.</p>
<p>Help yourself get informed about the spider situation and check out <a href="http://www.northwestexplorer.org/news/2013/10/24/spiders-spiders-everywhere/">Andrew Minter’s article</a> on the awful arachnids.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Tuesday, Sep. 10, Parliament voted for thousands of stray dogs in the city of Bucharest, Romania to be captured and euthanized.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decision came after four year old Ionut Anghel was attacked by five stray dogs in the city’s park, ending in his death.The family of the boy are supportive of this new movement of mass slaughter, but should their hatred be directed toward the dogs?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Residents who have been hit by tough economic times tend to leave their furry friends to fend for themselves, adding to the constantly growing number of strays in the city, which has become a dire problem. Stray dogs have been a rapidly expanding topic of debate in the last few years, with people accumulating countless bites over the last year alone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Romanian President Traian Basescu was quick to pass a bill euthanizing thousands of the strays, and stating in opposition of the option of sterilization, &#8220;dogs should not be put above humans.&#8221; This is a barbaric display of superiority when the real problem is not four legged.</p>
<p>But who knows what would happen if a bill at a national level were to be passed for the neutering of dogs; would it decrease the population of stray dogs and already overcrowded shelters? Possibly, but why make thousands upon thousands of homeless dogs suffer for the wrongdoings of their human counterparts?</p>
