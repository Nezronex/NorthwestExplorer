										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">1.     <strong>Don&#8217;t even think about procrastinating.</strong> You may have been able to pull off three hundred point projects the night before in the past, but not now &#8212; not only do you not have recovery time if you flop, but with so many harder projects, you cannot afford to get bad grades on time-consuming but easy projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. <strong>Study.</strong> Find papers from the first quarter and conduct a short review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">3.     <strong>Prioritize.</strong> During the week before finals &#8212; the week where we are all reasonably sure that teachers are cackling in a room over the amount they assigned us, and it is not humanly possible to get everything done &#8212; deal with the classes you have the lowest grade in. Then deal with the big projects; you can probably do worksheets during class or during lunch, whereas big papers are difficult to work on in another class.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">4.     <strong>Take short breaks.</strong> In between two heavy subjects, read a chapter of a fluffy book that doesn’t have a plot that would weigh on your mind. Go on a run. Watch a 20-minute show on Netflix.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">5.     <strong>Don&#8217;t mess with your eating habits.</strong> You need to have constants, so if you are on a giant studying binge, don&#8217;t decide that breakfast is a good idea at four in the morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">6.     <strong>Caffeine.</strong> Although caffeine is not that great for you, and over time it actually lowers your energy levels, once in a while, it can work like a placebo. If you think you are getting an energy boost from that Sprite, you can fool yourself into thinking you are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">7.     <strong>Ask teachers for a look at what will be on the finals.</strong> That way you won&#8217;t waste time on stuff you don’t need to know.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">8.    This is probably the most useful tip: <strong>find people who have taken the course you are in.</strong> Ask them about what you can do &#8212; experience is the best teacher.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
