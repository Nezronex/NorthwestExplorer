<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">A pungent smell invades the nostrils of Abby Fickle as she frantically grabs the keepsakes from her car. A sense of urgency seems to drown out the chaos, she grabs the last of her things that she can get at this moment and takes off. Away from her precious car as it is engulfed in flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Abby Fickle, a junior at Northwest who loved her car, a Volkswagen Beetle nicknamed Spike, an astronomical amount. For Abby and her friend Tianna Piña it was a fairly normal lunch at the start of a new year. They had just gotten into Abby’s car and had attempted to turn on the air conditioning. It turned on but both of them noticed a sliver of smoke emerging from the controls. At this point in time they still drove it around this is where the first signs of trouble started appearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The smell started becoming something very very strong to the point where you could feel it inside your stomach and made you grossed out,” Tianna Piña, (11), said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">After a while things started picking up, according to Tianna and Abby. The smoke grew darker black and increased in quantity. The stench carried by it became even more gut-wrenching at this point in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The black smoke kind of reminded me of a house fire, but luckily we were just in a car, so we could get out safely,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the black smoke started sweeping through her car, Fickle drove back to school grounds. Thinking quickly, Fickle drove her car into the parking lot away from other vehicles, calling her dad for advice and help. They opened up the hood and in the process discovered the fire on the side of her car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“He told us to disconnect the cable from the battery just in case that would help, and as I rounded the corner of the car we saw the fire fuming,” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the fire raged on, the windows were the first to break due to the intense heat. After that,&nbsp; Fickle and Piña were escorted away from the vehicle and into the nurse’s office. There the realization of what had truly happened hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“What was going through my mind was&nbsp; something that was new to me, and I don’t know why I reacted this way, but I started laughing,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">While Piña felt hysteria, Fickle understandably felt pure sadness not only that, but also she had endured a borderline traumatic experience. At the nurse’s office both were found to be healthy, despite all circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“I kept getting reminded by dad whenever I was sad about it, that if I had done anything different we both could have died, or something worse could have happened” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">The car itself was totaled, a large portion of it completely destroyed by flames. Fickle only had liability insurance though, leaving her without a vehicle at this moment, but Fickle does have plans to bring back some life back into an old mustang her sister owned.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“It’s weird, a change, but we worked on it all day and now I drive that,” Fickle said. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What got you interested in anime?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “My sister started reading a lot of the comic books when we were younger and then eventually I started reading some of those. I had, technically, been watching anime since I was a really little kid; I didn’t know it was anything different. Through different friends and family, it was just kind of a thing we watched and then when I was in my tweens and teen years then I just discovered ‘oh my gosh this is a big thing!’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What got you interested in cosplaying?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: “I’ve been coming to anime fest in Wichita for seven years now. And I&#8217;ve actually been making costumes and sewing since I was 6 and 7. I’ve actually been making costumes way before I had my realization about anime, but when I found out that I can have both of them together I just started sewing costumes and eventually I started competing in competitions.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: Have you been to other conventions other than the one in Wichita?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “I’ve been to ton of cons in the US. Not lots of big ones but I&#8217;ve started to expand a bit more.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What inspired your costume?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “I actually made every single piece of this. I pattered all of these &nbsp;[pieces of] clothing by myself. I do not use any store bought patterns. I do all of the sizing from scratch and, this whole prop and everything, I built myself.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This actually has a manga and an anime, its actually quite old. It’s called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardcaptor Sakura</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it’s one of the original, magical girl series. It’s kind of around the same age as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;.Kind of like in the 90s.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What&#8217;s your favorite anime? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>A:&nbsp;“I don’t think I have a specific favorite show. As far as certain movies, genres, and series that I like, I like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio Ghibli </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movies. Those were one of the first things I watched when I was a kid and they were amazing&#8230;.they’re some of the best parts of my childhood. They’re such inspirational, sweet, adventurous movies. It’s always amazing.” </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her costume took her nine hours and three evenings to make. Most of her costumes take longer than that, but this specific costume (as shown in the photo) was one of her most simple ones. She has multiple versions of the same character, therefore reusing the same wig and prop. </span></li>

I just come, mainly, to see all my friends that I, honestly, have through cosplay and whatnot. I just come to hang out and everything. I haven&#8217;t been doing any cosplay here in the last couple of years just because I&#8217;ve been working on other stuff. I used to be pretty big into it.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Construction is finally upon us. Northwest has heard about expansion for a while now, but did not know when it was supposed to happen. Initial site work started in August while the only construction that has started is for culinary arts and the CDC. Construction crews began breaking  ground earlier this month and started working on the band room.</p>
<p>“The band area, along with the culinary arts and FACS area,” Principal Gil Alvarez said, “should just be closed for this school year.”</p>
<p>The band room will also be a safe shelter after construction, and it should be up and running by the beginning of next school year. Doors are now closed in the G hall exit, the CDC entrance to the school, and the main entrance to the gym. All students trying to get into the gym or pool for athletic events must enter from the main Tyler Street doors.</p>
<p>“The gym area will probably be closed for two years,” Alvarez said.</p>
<p>Alvarez says exits being closed will be an inconvenience but will be manageable. With the East side area being fenced off, band students will only have one exit when walking out for practice and teachers have had to relocate for new places to park. This has caused a lot of congestion in both the Tyler and 13th parking lots. Another inconvenience is some of the routes to get out of the school during drills might have changed slightly.</p>
<p>“We just ask for flexibility during the construction stages because it’s going to be a lot of things going on,” Alvarez said, “and we want to make sure we allow that flexibility during the construction so it can be completed.”</p>
<p>There will be more changes happening throughout the year which should start in October.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Media controls society to the point where we are heading down the road of fulfilling the prediction of living in a Bradbury/Orwell world. Many of the companies who run the media have merged, giving the aforementioned countries a monopoly on what you learn by way of the TV, news stations, and online news articles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tests prove that every time you read, watch, or see something, it is stored in the back of your brain. Read too much by the same source and you start becoming influenced.  In 2009, a study was conducted that teenagers spend an average of 31 hours a week on the internet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Dr. Anthony Curtis, five companies hold 95 percent of the revenue in media: Walt Disney, Viacom, News Corporation, Time Warner and CBS. Chances are, with the 31 hours teenagers tend to spend on the Internet, teenagers begin to be influenced by at least one of the media moguls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With most of the internet being ran by one of five companies, it is easy to only hear one side of the story. Read the same kind of articles from the same source over and over and you take the power out of your own hands by giving up the power of your own opinion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Make sure you listen to multiple sources before coming up with your own opinion. Listen to both sides. (Read both the pros and cons, both sides of the argument, watch both Fox News and CNN.) Be sure of your personal beliefs and values. Do not let a persuasive sounding article sway you to do anything. It is easier to close a pop-up ad then it is to simply hit the red X on doubts niggling at you in your own head. Don’t put yourself in danger by simply accepting everything you are told.</p>
