										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year since the school opened up in 1978, the yearbook has been delivered in the fall of the next school year. But this year, change is coming to Northwest, when the yearbooks will be distributed in the spring.</p>
<p>The yearbook staff made the change in hopes of increasing yearbook sales.</p>
<p>The yearbook will cover events from August-February. The last four months will be recorded with a 28 page insert that will be mailed to seniors and distributed to freshmen, sophomores and juniors the following school year.</p>
<p>This change was both stressful and exciting for the yearbook staff.</p>
<p>“We completely changed everything,” senior and editor and chief of the yearbook Kayla Schenck said. “We are doing weekly coverage, so anything that happens within a week is on a page.”</p>
<p>Schenck hopes that  people will enjoy the book more. Another member of the staff, Rebecca Heberly, is looking forward to the spring delivery as well.</p>
<p>“It’s so much better [because] people will actually get to see the yearbook.”</p>
<p>In the past, many graduates had not returned to pick up their books, leaving boxes of paid-for books in storage.</p>
<p>Seniors will get their books during senior breakfast on May 8. Underclassmen can pick theirs up during Advocacy that day.</p>
