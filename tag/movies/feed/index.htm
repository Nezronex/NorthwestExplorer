										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this past summer on July 21st, movie theaters were packed with people going to see one of two very different movies. On one side of the room all you could see were booming pink outfits, on the other established and distinct suits. This event was known on social media as “Barbenheimer” which is the combination of the names of the two movies that were premiering that day, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This double premiere made a great deal of noise due to both movies having very recognizable directors and actors behind it. People were making plans on which one they would see first and also what outfits they would wear to match the vibe of each movie.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the crowds started to disperse and all the popcorn had been popped, people were quick to voice their opinions on how they felt over the movies, and Northwest students did not fall behind.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I went to see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">because honestly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn’t interest me like the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movie did, and personally I loved it. I felt like it was really good commentary on womanhood, but also the struggles that both men and women face in society,” Audrey Buser (11) said.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved to be one of the most successful movies of the year so far making $1.34 billion and while Buser has only seen </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there’s equally other students that have only seen </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did not see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went to go see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m kind of a historical guy, I really like movies about the past and I’m also a little bit of a WWII geek so I like anything from that time, but I thought the movie was a little too long and I noticed it didn’t get a lot of promotion. I didn’t know of it until I saw a trailer at the movie theater,” Gabriel Bakker (12) said.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some students didn’t just see one movie, but instead went to both showings and were able to witness all the trends that took place.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to see Oppenheimer because it looked like a visually good movie and I thought it would be really good at IMAX, but I also wanted to see Barbie because it felt like a fun movie to go to and a fun thing to be at the theater for,” Elijah Gegen (12) said.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gegen expressed his excitement and reason for wanting to see both movies and very quickly gave us his thoughts after seeing them, he also told us which one he liked better.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a hard decision, but I think I liked Oppenheimer better, Barbie had some really good messages and it was just a fun movie to see, but with Oppenheimer I think it was like a really historically accurate movie and I feel like you know someone for one thing, but there’s also so much other things that happened for that to happen,” Gegen added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It’s that time of year again. Time to curl up and eat the candy your mom bought for other peoples’ kids and watch movies that make you laugh, or scream depending on how well you take horror movies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are a few of my personal favorite horror classics:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084516/">Poltergeist</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I first saw this as a kid and I’ve loved it ever since. There’s something I like about a good ghost story that draws me in to this film. For those of you who haven’t seen this movie, this is the one that started the “build on an ancient burial ground” trope. An unsuspecting family moves into a house that turns out to be haunted, and they hire psychics to help cleanse it. It’s a classic and a must-see for anyone in the family.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: A few jump scares and a happy ending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also See: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087363/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">Gremlins</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Ghost Busters</a> for something more tame.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077651/">Halloween</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">What better movie to celebrate Halloween? This movie follows the dreaded killer Michael Myers and his infamous mask. And a reboot. This is one of those movies you can catch on movie channels, or at least you can catch one of the several sequels. Or the reboot. The reboot was pretty good.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: This one can get kinda gory; it’s a classic slasher film.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also See: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/?ref_=nv_sr_6">Nightmare on Elm Street</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080761/?ref_=nv_sr_3">Friday the 13th</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking of slasher films, why don’t we talk about one of the most famous horror films of all time? Friday the 13th is about Jason (yes, the hockey mask Jason, although he doesn’t wear it in this one) and his adventures in a summer camp full of teenagers. It goes as well as you would expect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: A good ol’ chainsaw slasher flick perfect for a weekend of sequels!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also See: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072271/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> if you really dig chainsaws, or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094862/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">Child’s Play</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185937/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Blair Witch Project</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The first person perspective combined with the powerful threat makes this movie a leader in  genre of found-recording thriller movies. Its ending makes it all the more terrifying, and real. It plays off the atmospheric tension to scare some, but bore others. Love it or hate it, it’s an archetype.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: Jump scares and not much gore.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also See: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179904/">Paranormal Activity</a> for more found-footage fun.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&#8211;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/?ref_=tt_rec_tti">The Shining</a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">This not only thrills you but leaves an impact. With wonderful acting that seems almost too good for Jack Nicholson to be completely sane, it left it’s mark on pop culture as well. Many scenes such as the door scene, the twins, and the infamous “redrum” writings. The novel of the same name is equally brilliant, but that is beside the point. This is a movie about a man’s descent into madness and the unseen forces behind it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scare Factor: This movie leaves an impact; I always feel thrilled afterwards.</p>
<p>Also See: For more of King’s works try <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074285/">Carrie</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087050/">Children of the Corn</a>, also see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">The Ring </a>and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364385/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">The Grudge</a>.</p>
