<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">A pungent smell invades the nostrils of Abby Fickle as she frantically grabs the keepsakes from her car. A sense of urgency seems to drown out the chaos, she grabs the last of her things that she can get at this moment and takes off. Away from her precious car as it is engulfed in flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Abby Fickle, a junior at Northwest who loved her car, a Volkswagen Beetle nicknamed Spike, an astronomical amount. For Abby and her friend Tianna Piña it was a fairly normal lunch at the start of a new year. They had just gotten into Abby’s car and had attempted to turn on the air conditioning. It turned on but both of them noticed a sliver of smoke emerging from the controls. At this point in time they still drove it around this is where the first signs of trouble started appearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The smell started becoming something very very strong to the point where you could feel it inside your stomach and made you grossed out,” Tianna Piña, (11), said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">After a while things started picking up, according to Tianna and Abby. The smoke grew darker black and increased in quantity. The stench carried by it became even more gut-wrenching at this point in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The black smoke kind of reminded me of a house fire, but luckily we were just in a car, so we could get out safely,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the black smoke started sweeping through her car, Fickle drove back to school grounds. Thinking quickly, Fickle drove her car into the parking lot away from other vehicles, calling her dad for advice and help. They opened up the hood and in the process discovered the fire on the side of her car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“He told us to disconnect the cable from the battery just in case that would help, and as I rounded the corner of the car we saw the fire fuming,” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the fire raged on, the windows were the first to break due to the intense heat. After that,&nbsp; Fickle and Piña were escorted away from the vehicle and into the nurse’s office. There the realization of what had truly happened hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“What was going through my mind was&nbsp; something that was new to me, and I don’t know why I reacted this way, but I started laughing,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">While Piña felt hysteria, Fickle understandably felt pure sadness not only that, but also she had endured a borderline traumatic experience. At the nurse’s office both were found to be healthy, despite all circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“I kept getting reminded by dad whenever I was sad about it, that if I had done anything different we both could have died, or something worse could have happened” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">The car itself was totaled, a large portion of it completely destroyed by flames. Fickle only had liability insurance though, leaving her without a vehicle at this moment, but Fickle does have plans to bring back some life back into an old mustang her sister owned.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“It’s weird, a change, but we worked on it all day and now I drive that,” Fickle said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people have a celebrity/tik tok idol. An idol is a person you look up to(most likely a famous/popular person).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshman Elayne Logan looks up to 40 year old musician, tiktoker, and author Hank Green. Hank Green talks about science and answers a lot of science questions on his tiktok. Logan said she looks up to Green because of who he is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look up to Hank Green. Why? ‘Cause he&#8217;s a scientist. He knows so much, answers all my sciency science question and he’s just Bill Nye on TikTok,” Logan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also said Green makes things enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ I mean he’s really funny and puts science in a way that’s enjoyable. He asks the questions that are useless but fun to know,” Logan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Junior Rylee Lopez looks up to 40 year old model, producer, and actress Kim Kardashian. Kim Kardashian is married to Kayne West and has a reality TV show called Keeping up with the Kardashian’s. Lopez said she looks up to Kardashian because of her social activism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She has fought for criminal justice reform and has helped Cynthia Brown gain freedom after being unfairly sentenced to life without parole.” Lopez said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also said Kardashian is a great mother and is also really funny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ I think she is a great mother and a great wife despite all the craziness she has had to deal with. I used to watch ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians’ and I just found Kim funny.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaylee Bates looks up to 27 year old singer-songwriter and talent show judge Maghan Trainor. Trainor is a singer who blew up with her song “All about that Bass”. Bates said she looks up to Trainor because she speaks on body positivity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A celebrity that I look up to is Meghan Trainor because she isn’t bothered about what people think of her and she is proud of her body. She doesn’t try to change herself for others,” Bates said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bates also said she likes her music because it is so positive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her music makes me happy because it tells people that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their body and that they are perfect the way they are without trying,” Bates said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People look up to others for different reasons and they keep them happy. Singer Ariana Grande says it best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Never hate on someone’s idol, they can be the only reason they are still alive.”&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FCCLA has a national membership of over 175,000 young men and women. There are 53 state associations including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, etc. FCCLA was founded in 1945, FCCLA has involved over nine million youth. This year Sara Abrahams had made an official group for Northwest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FCCLA group participates in community service activities, last week they did an operation holiday and last year They did competitions for things. Some of their activities include personal finances, consumer rights, and responsibilities, technology, health, and safety,&nbsp; environment, and FCCLA knowledge. With COVID, all of the competitions are online this year so they are not participating in them. Anyone at Northwest has the ability to join this after school group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s shown to be more beneficial to have joined if you have FAC classes (family and consumer sciences)classes that you have taken but it’s not required. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community service is apart of the class for this program but no background checks happen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since COVID had a set-back for many students and activities the FCCLA group meets once a week after school on teams. Being in-person makes it to where there are more opportunities for students to be able to do the activities available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara Abraham is the leader of the after school program, and Jesse Hancock is the President of the program led at Northwest. Right now there are a total of eight students that are in the group. This group is also available for students of all grade levels to join.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group usually meets around 2:45 P.M. making it to where you are able to join during their advocacy hour. During the time they meet, the group discusses what they are able to do around the community. This consists of things like picking up trash, operation holiday, etc. Sara Abraham explained that since things are mostly online it has been more difficult to do activities, she also explained that most community service project that is done in larger groups have been put to a halt because of the social distancing matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fcclainc.org is the official website for the program that Sara Abraham and a couple of other students are participating in. Students who are in the after-school program have the ability to earn scholarships by the end of their senior year. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With quarantine keeping students all holed up inside their houses,&nbsp; students and teachers have had to come up with some creative ways to keep in contact, especially with school and after school clubs. But Covid-19 has not stopped the debate team from progressing and moving forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, the debate club chooses a topic to learn about and discuss in debates. This year, the topic is criminal justice. The students then prepare evidence and pair up with another student to face off with another student pair in front of at least one adult judge. But now, instead of doing the debates in-person, the debates take place within organized and structured Zoom meetings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong group of debaters has made overcoming this challenge easier according to the debate coach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have an incredible group this year,” said debate teacher, Peter Crevoiserat, who is better known as Mr. Crevo. “I have more students in debate this year than any of my previous years, which is exciting, and I hope that trend continues. (&#8230;) If more people stick with debate, the sky&#8217;s the limit.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophomore Makayla Coy says debating this year is challenging, but still rewarding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A typical debate meeting now is kind of crazy from what it used to be,” Coy said.” “This was me and my partner’s first year, so we’ve gotten a grip on things. It’s been hard, but if you put your mind to it then it’s okay. (&#8230;) Other than that debate is great and I’m glad I joined it.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team has gone to three tournaments thus far, placing 3rd in two tournaments overall. The current top pair, consisting of Rylee Lopez and Josee Hoshaw, have placed in every tournament.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both students and teachers are still trying to adjust to the online experience.&nbsp; A day in the life of a Northwest student starts at 8 a.m. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">except for Early College Academy program students who start at 7 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students of various grades have different perspectives and outlooks when it comes to the online experience. Students have more free time and most of the time isn’t a good thing in their eyes. Some students said they can’t focus well and get bored easily. One plus about online school according to some is it’s easier for students to stay organized. They don’t have papers all over the place to keep track of or papers they could accidentally throw away.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some experiences that students don’t get this year, but there are still many good things coming out of it. The organization is a key thing to keeping the online school experience from getting messy and out of place.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I was not very organized when I went in person so online is honestly helping me be more organized,” Gage Weaver, junior, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of different views on if going online is better or worse for the organizational skills of students. Students such as Miranda Lewis think going online for schooling this year is better for the organizational skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s honestly easier to stay organized online because I don’t have a bunch of papers to keep track of,” Miranda Lewis, sophomore, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going online has caused many students to miss out on extracurricular activities and experiences. Freshmen this year are missing out on meeting new people and growing to know their teachers better. Seniors are missing out on spending time with their friends in their last year of high school. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are some perks to staying at home, many miss being around people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I do enjoy being able to stay in bed, but I do miss being in a classroom and being able to build relationships with my teachers and classmates,” Lewis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One positive side to schools being online this year is that people have fewer chances of getting sick and students and teachers both get to experience this new way of learning together. There are still times where students are able to make fun of the situation and become friends with new people in instances where teachers put students in breakout rooms. With schools going online, it also gives students more opportunities to go in-depth with their work; they just have to be able to use their time management skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something I would highlight would definitely be those times when the class is in awkward silence. I just find that hilarious,” Ayah Gharbi, freshman, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Weaver also has mixed feelings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some highs for the classes have been learning stuff that will apply in the future with financial literacy, and a low has been math homework,” Weaver said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the reviews are mixed for remote learning, it&#8217;s likely to continue as long as the Board of Education determines it is the best way to protect students and staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Online school is something some students love and some students hate, but we have to do to stay safe,” Jaya Smith, freshman, said.</span></p>
