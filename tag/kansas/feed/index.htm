Watson and other representatives from the Department of Education visited Machine Tools 1, taught by Bryan Jones, members of the Pro-Start program led by Alison Draut, and Jeff Darr’s Marketing Research class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watson hoped to measure how his visions of teaching both college readiness and employability skills are being carried out in the classrooms. Northwest was the place to visit in part because of the 38-40 CTE courses it offers, including 14-18 different career pathways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Oborny, Entrepreneurship Task Force (ETF) co-chair attested to the success of the business pathway at Northwest. He credits the growth of an elementary school business program, from one competition to now three competitions, to Northwest DECA. This initiative was led by seniors Matthew Colborn, Kyle Wegleitner, Dakota West. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DECA and Northwest High has been very helpful in developing that program and also starting to scale it,” Oborny said. “They’ve done a great job, represented their age group really well and done tremendous service to the community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draut’s Pro-Start program has achieved similar success. In her classroom, recently renovated to reflect the equipment used in real commercial restaurant facilities, students are able to earn industry-recognized certificates. Junior Nicole Shartzer was able to earn two promotions at her job thanks to the certification earned in class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neely Carson, who serves on the CTE advisory committee, says this is exactly what the CTE program hopes to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all about cultivating the next group of leaders within our industries,” Carson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principal Gil Alvarez is pleased to see the commissioner’s vision being achieved within the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you talk about college and career ready skills, employability skills, the critical thinking, the problem solving, the collaboration that you have,” Alvarez said. “It’s everything we want students to be able to do when they leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron Weddle, director of the Wichita Manufacturing Association, understands that there is still work left to be done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think there are enough kids going into particularly the manufacturing world to meet the needs coming forward,” Weddle said. “They have the basic skill sets, they’re all great with their fingers and their iPads. That’s the factory of the future. We just need to make sure they understand how to use those skill sets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest’s CTE program is moving toward doing just that, which is very important in Carson’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to prepare kids for the next step in life,” Carson said. “We have to get them ready to enter the workforce.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">On Tuesday, Feb. 11, the Kansas House of Representatives approved a bill that would prevent private and public employees from being required to “provide any services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges; provide counseling, adoption, foster care and other social services; or provide employment or employment benefits” (House Bill 2453) for same-sex couples. The stated purpose of the bill is to protect the religious liberty of employees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Individual clerks now have the right to reject serving same sex-couples if it conflicts with the clerk’s religious principles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, if a woman and her girlfriend rely on the city bus for transportation to work, a bus driver can now simply deny them the ability to ride that bus. A professor at a university can refuse to teach partners of the same sex.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Essentially, Kansas legislators are in the process of legalizing discrimination.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was indeed a time when laws were passed to sanction prejudice. That was in the late 1870’s, when Jim Crow laws were first being enacted. Shouldn’t we have moved past this mindset by 2014?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another issue I have with bill 2453 is how it singles out only one of the many abominations mentioned in the Bible. According to Leviticus 20:13, “If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death.” (Deuteronomy 14 also discusses that eating from a pig is an abomination. So is eating shrimp.) Proverbs 23:20-21 says the practice of gluttony is an abomination. Deuteronomy 22:22 says that the cost for committing adultery is death.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yet, no bills are being discussed to prevent hotel owners from loaning out a room to a woman they think might be cheating on her husband. We haven’t tried to give waiters or waitresses permission to not serve overweight customers because they don’t want to endorse gluttony. The bill only protects religious liberty of employees when it relates to the topic of homosexuality. It specifically targets the rights of same-sex couples. This defines discrimination, and I am mortified that Kansas would attempt to legalize such a thing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I know that Kansas is a red state. I know that Kansas doesn’t embrace tolerance. But I never thought that we would actually consider legalizing discrimination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">After coming back from Christmas vacation after languishing on a silky beach in Puerto Rico or getting some fresh air upon a mountain top, Kansas seems rather dull.  Here is a short list reminding everyone why there is no place like home.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">1.     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6DJcgm3wNY">We have Superman.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Clark Kent may not be real, but Kansas takes the spotlight whenever the Man of Steel pops up in comics, movies, or TV. The DC comic character was raised in the small Kansas town of Smallville, which means that Kansas has dibs on one of the most famous superheroes of all time.  I don’t know about anyone else, but my family knuckle-bumped when Superman told the general that, “I was raised in Kansas. I’m about as American as it gets,” in the new movie.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2.     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU">Oz</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike other states that have issues with tornadoes, our tornadoes throw people into worlds with munchkins and pretty red shoes. Frank L Baum’s novel is about a Kansas girl named Dorothy who travels through the land of Oz with her dog, Toto in order to find the Wizard.  Nominated for six Academy awards, The Wizard of Oz is one of the most popular American movies to date.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3.     <a href="https://twitter.com/pizzahut">Pizza Hut</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Not only did Pizza Hut originate in Kansas, it came from Wichita, making it extra special. Despite efforts to make sure this does not become an ad&#8230;Pizza hut is the best pizza ever. Those who disagree clearly have never attended a sleepover where your so-called friends dare you to drink something so bad you don’t think you will ever be able to taste anything again and then you bite into an absolutely gorgeous piece of Canadian bacon&#8230;bliss. Pizza hut is not the only business to originate in Wichita and do well. Taco Tico, White Castle, and Freddy’s are other Wichita restaurant alumni.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4.     <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLoICzrsi7c">Dennis the Menace</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have ever picked up a newspaper&#8230;ever..you have probably met the lovable mischievous boy that is the namesake of the comic strip that was the basis for several TV series and  movies. However, you may not have known that Dennis the Menace is supposed to live in Wichita Kansas. To be precise, he lives on 2251 Pine Road.  Fun act: For a while, Dennis the Menace was DQ’s mascot. He is just that awesome.</p>
<p dir="ltr">5.     <a href="https://www.scz.org">Sedgwick County Zoo</a></p>
<p>Without trying to brag, we have one of the best zoos in the country.  The Sedgwick Country Zoo is ranked nationally, participates in multiple breeding programs, and just keeps getting better. Over 400 species of animals including red pandas, tigers and penguins  call the zoo home. Currently, it is ranked as Kansas’s number one outdoor family destination.</p>
