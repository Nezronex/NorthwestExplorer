										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 dir="ltr">It&#8217;s time to make scholarships your focus!</h1>
<p dir="ltr">You can find opportunities through nonprofit organizations, and small and large companies. Ask your employer, your parent’s employer, and your church. You never know where an opportunity may exist.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What should you do?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Schedule time in your week to work on scholarship applications. It can quickly feel overwhelming, so take a look at your schedule and plug it in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Utilize websites to find scholarships some examples being:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cappex.com/">www.cappex.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.studentscholarships.org/">www.studentscholarships.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fastweb.com/">www.fastweb.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>(Make sure you don’t pay anyone or any site a fee for scholarships. That can be a sign of a scam.)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Check out your community colleges.</strong> Most community colleges offer activity scholarships that can pay up to books and tuition. Activities may include athletics, music, drama, yearbook, newspaper, photography, writing, being a student ambassador, or being a leader! Attend a community college and receive your first couple of years of college for close to free!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Anything else?</h2>
<ul>
<li> Check out the CCC fusion page, it also has a list of scholarship opportunities that the school has received. Make sure to check it out!</li>
<li> You can also feel free to stop by the CCC to discuss your plans and see what scholarships you may qualify for, passes can be given by Danea Cramer in A-26 for advocacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow the CCC @nw_ccc on Twitter for all of the latest information related to life after high school. </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 dir="ltr">Scholarship Information</h1>
<h3 dir="ltr">Upcoming Scholarships Deadlines:</h3>
<ul>
<li>November 1 – KSU and KU</li>
<li>November 15 – FHSU</li>
</ul>
<p>To find additional scholarship opportunities consider creating an account at any of the following sites, each provide FREE scholarship searches for you!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cappex.com/">www.cappex.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.studentscholarships.org/">www.studentscholarships.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zinch.com/">www.zinch.com</a></li>
<li>Scholarships can also be found on the CCC fusionpage.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><em>You must apply for admission and be accepted to qualify for scholarships. This is done by applying for admission, paying the application fee and sending your transcript and ACT scores.</em></p>
<h1 dir="ltr">The ACT</h1>
<h3 dir="ltr">Deadlines and Dates</h3>
<ul>
<li>The deadline for the December 14 ACT is Friday, November 8.</li>
<li>WSU will be hosting an ACT Prep Workshop on November 16. The cost is $32. Register on-line at <a href="http://www.registerblast.com/wsu">www.registerblast.com/wsu</a>.</li>
<li>The CCC will be hosting an ACT Prep Workshop on Monday, December 2 during Advocacy. Sign-up in the CCC.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">ACT Reminders</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select colleges that you want  to receive your ACT scores and make sure to upload your photo when registering.</li>
<li>There is an app for iPhones, iPads, and Android devices that allows you upload your picture in less than a minute. If you prefer, you can stop by the CCC in A-26 and upload it there.</li>
<li>When you register for the ACT it is extremely important to select the colleges you want to see your scores, as ACT scores will no longer appear on your transcript, so therefore Northwest can no longer send them to colleges for you.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t choose the colleges you want to receive your scores, you will pay $13 for each score report to be sent to colleges. <em>That will get expensive quickly.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">College Visits</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
If you have not visited colleges that you are interested in, now is the time to do that. Visiting campus allow you get a “feel” for the environment of the college. For many students, the campus visit is the deciding factor on whether or not they attend that college. When scheduling the visit, make sure to give the college two weeks notice that your requests can be made. You can choose to tour the campus, see the residence halls, meet with a professor, speak with financial aid, etc. You can make it how you want it.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Career Fits</h1>
<h3>Struggling to figure out your career fit? Check out these websites for personality &amp; career assessments.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Holland Code Assessment. The Holland Code theory explains work-related behavior such as, which career choices are likely to lead to job success and satisfaction. It also explains other human actions, like success and satisfaction in school and training programs.<br />
