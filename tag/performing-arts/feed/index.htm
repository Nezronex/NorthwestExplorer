										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">She never imagined she’d be teaching. She thought she would become a professional singer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“My dream was to travel and be in music theatre,” said choir teacher Amy Brown.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Brown studied at Arizona State University for her major in music theatre, she was involved in a total of 25 shows. In pursuing her dream in music theatre, she got pregnant and decided it was time to stop performing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Never wanting to give up on her passion for music, she chose to start teaching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She enjoys teaching because teaching to her is like “parts of a team to make a goal.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">During her time at Arizona, she stumbled upon a man who she would later call her husband.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Needless to say, they fell in love, got married, and had kids. At this point Brown realized she should probably settle down and stop performing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown was relentless to quit music theatre all together and made a decision to begin teaching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown substituted at Wichita State University in 2000 for a while, and then moved on to a more official teaching job at Wilbur Middle School. Brown taught at Wilbur for 6 years and enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ve always loved seeing people grow and change,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After working at Wilbur for quite some time, Brown was offered a job as the choir teacher for Northwest High School; she accepted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No matter what life threw at her, she could never drift from her musical habits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So here she is now, her tenth year teaching for USD 259, inspiring her kids everyday and being inspired herself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There’s this amazing thing where people think they can’t do it, then you work with them and they do it,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown loves teaching at Northwest and is always looking for ways to make each choir just a little bit better.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We can do stuff at a professional level,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though teaching wasn’t her original plan, Brown doesn’t regret her decision.</p>
<p>“Seeing that kid who never thought they could do it, do it. It’s addictive,” Brown said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A chorus of cheerful greetings echoed throughout the Northwest Auditorium as dining car waiters with buttery popcorn, charming country accents, and bright smiles ushered in the Northwest Theatre Department’s opening performance. The performing season kicked off with Irving Berlin’s western comedy “Annie Get Your Gun” Friday, Oct. 4 and 5 at 7 p.m., and Sunday, Oct. 6 at 2 p.m.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gun-totin’, sharp-shootin’ Annie Oakley falls in love with the star of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, Frank Butler, upon his arrival in town. Frank prefers a girl who is “as soft and as pink as a nursery,” however, much to Annie’s dismay. When Annie proves to be a better marksman than Frank, she lessens her chances of them being happy together even further. In the end, the two sharpshooters hold a rematch and Annie allows Frank to win the contest, but the competition ends up being a draw. Frank falls in love with Annie and the two sharpshooters get married.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Northwest presentation of “Annie Get Your Gun” was, simply put, delightful. The charismatic dining car waiters before the show left the audience anticipating more country style charm. They weren’t disappointed- the chemistry between cast members, the adept musical orchestra personnel and the overwhelming talent of the performers created the most entrancing atmosphere. Director Richard Lundin chose cast members for the show flawlessly and the students executed their roles just as well. As Frank Butler and Company said, there’s no business like show business- and certainly none like Northwest show business.</p>
