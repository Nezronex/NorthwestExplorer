										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Superheroes are here to save television.</p>
<p>Well, to be precise, TV networks want superheroes, and their massive pre-existing fanbase  to bring them viewers (and therefore money).Several TV channels are planning to bring the stories of several comic book heroes and villains to life.</p>
<p>Fox is bringing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d1zpt6k5OI">GOTHAM</a> to the table, a show that picks up right after Bruce Wayne’s parents are murdered. It is being marketed as a giant origin story for both heroes and villains told from the POV of detective Jim Gordon. The only Batman villain not expected to make an appearance is Ra’s Al Ghul, the leader of the League of Assassins, the theory behind the absence of the villain is thought to be because he is expected to appear in the CW’s ARROW.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKE36sL6jKc">ARROW</a> is a popular television show based off of DC comics’ Green Arrow franchise and is currently hyping up excitement by releasing clips of major villain Ra’s Al Ghul, car chases, and appearances of Ray Palmer; the man who will later become The Atom.  It’s spin-off, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj0l7iGKh8g">THE FLASH</a>, features bumbling forensic scientist Barry Allen who finds himself struck by lighting and in a coma for nine months, only to wake up as the fastest man alive. After the pilot was screened at the San Diego Comic-Con, critics agreed that THE FLASH was not only the most promising of all of the new shows,but was also the most lighthearted, unlike it’s grittier “mother” show, or its competition,  NBC’s CONSTANTINE.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPE2oBnzROY">CONSTANTINE</a> is aiming to bring horror lovers to NBC with a TV series centered around the darker, scarier, side of comics. Think paranormal activity with a detective/vigilante as the lead character with DC characters such as Doctor Fate and Zatanna teased to join the show later.</p>
<p>On MARVEL side of the television spectrum, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tkfi6QtZQw">Agents of SHIELD</a> (whose ratings improved after Captain America: Winter soldier) is being renewed for a second season with the underlying uneasiness of “no-one-can-be-trusted” chatter surrounding the show following the revealing of major characters in the show being connected to HYDRA.  While Marvel seems to be dragging its feet with its other upcoming TV series, AGENT CARTER,  other properties are being put into the “in development” stage.</p>
<p>Whether you like superheroes or not, the sheer amount of DC/Marvel shows on television is important. First, it shows what people want to watch, which means TV channels will order similar shows, leading to realistic TV shows having a much harder job selling their pitch. Second, comics shows off America in a way nothing else can. Every culture has stories that change and reflect the views of that particular group as time goes on. The Greeks had their myths, the British have King Arthur, but comic books? Comic books really started turning into something popular in America during the Great Depression, and the stories have grown with America, featured American heroes (Captain America) and reflected American values and beliefs. In the end, aren’t most comic book heros supposed to represent truth, justice, and the American way?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">During our three days of snow, I decided to watch Netflix-lots of Netflix. After scrolling through my comfort shows, starting a new show sounded like a good idea since I had three days to binge and drool over said show if I liked it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the description, Chuck is a show about a guy named Chuck who is an underachiever who gets government secrets downloaded into his head and turns into a government asset. The description alone was what made me avoid it: it sounded dumb. So I went in thinking it would be something like the people who wrote a sitcom trying their hand at a grittier type of show.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was wrong. Completely wrong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck is a person who got kicked out of Stanford unfairly who has had all of his confidence crushed by working at a California version of Best Buy and is the head of the Nerd Herd, a group who goes out and fixes computers. His ex-best friend who turns out to be a rogue government agent sends him an email that uses embedded pictures to implant government secrets into his head-and then the only computer holding the secrets now in Chuck&#8217;s head is destroyed.  A CIA agent, Sarah Walker (the love interest) and NSA agent John Casey are sent to protect him-but they soon realize the only way to use the information for good is to take him on missions with them, forcing Chuck to balance his spy life and real life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The characters were great and likable.  Chuck is sweet and has a strong moral code, which conflicts often with the wants of the CIA, and makes for a likeable lead character. Sarah is an agent who uses her looks to go undercover, which distracts from the fact she is highly trained in martial artist with relationship issues.  John Casey is a tough, trigger-happy  NSA agent with a fearsome demeanor. Together, the three of them form a triad of awesome  to head up the “A” plot line. His sister, her fiance Devon (More commonly known as ‘Captain Awesome’, from the family of ‘Very Awesomes), his best friend Morgan and the Nerd Herd usually form the “B” plot, which is what is happening in Chuck’s real life and usually pretty goofy. Sometime in the episode, both storylines collide forcing Chuck to cover for himself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The show is smart, funny, and engaging. No character is useless and the show throws out plenty of jokes without sacrificing plot. By the end of the episode, you wonder how on earth they packed so much into one episode, and it is addictive. I burst out laughing several times, whether it was at Captain Awesome’s horrible lying skills (“I didn’t pick up my phone because I was decapitating a bear!) or Casey saying everything in the same grating voice.  (“Don’t puke on the C4”) No line is wasted and you end up falling in love with the characters, no matter how bad they screw up. And every character grows, so the show never gets stale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Verdict: I loved it. Normally crime shows bore me, but I was able to sit through episode after episode, which makes itself the first show that has not been sci-fi/fantasy to make me do that. This is such an underrated show that deserves to have a bigger fanbase than it does. It’s on Netflix, so I would recommend going home and watching it-if you think you can stop at one.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIqEWRt8sBo">How to be a deadly spy according to John Casey</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Quote from the show:</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t do that, because I have two protectors that will come running with guns blazing when they hear my girly scream”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Many students have turned away from the TV and have started relying on Netflix to watch their favorite TV shows. But what are they watching? After asking around Northwest, here are the results. (Results are listed in no particular order)</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Doctor Who</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a special year for the “Whovians”; Doctor Who is celebrating fifty years of being on the air, making it the longest-running sci-fi series of all time. Doctor Who started in the nineteen-sixties, was cancelled, brought back on the air with a TV movie, and finally rebooted in 2006.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The show follows the adventures of the Doctor, an alien who travels throughout time and space in his TARDIS with his human companions. Full of memorable characters, smart plot lines and moments that make you cry your eyes out, Doctor Who is not only a good show, it is a good story.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Come on, look at me! No plan, no backup, no weapons worth a damn, oh, and something else I don&#8217;t have: anything to lose! So, if you&#8217;re sitting up there in your silly little space ships with all your silly little guns, and you&#8217;ve got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight, just remember who&#8217;s standing in your way! Remember every black day I ever stopped you, and then, and then, do the smart thing! Let somebody else try first. -The 11th Doctor, Season Five: The Pandorica Opens</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vIsQ25Krq8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vIsQ25Krq8</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">-Whitney</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Merlin</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it often gets overshadowed by other BBC shows, Merlin was the first show for a very long time to air on a major American TV broadcaster: NBC. Although it ended last Christmas with an amount of viewers to rival Doctor Who, people are still watching it on Netflix. The show puts a twist on the King Arthur Legend: Arthur and Merlin are the same age, and magic is punishable by death in Camelot. Every character changes immensely throughout the series and each has a secret. The relationships are  done tastefully, the plots were excellent, friendship between the characters made the show, and the snappy dialogue set it apart from other medieval shows. The US tagline for the show says it best: Some fight for justice, others fight for power, all fight for Camelot. Personally, out of all the TV shows on this list, Merlin is my favorite.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">The love that binds us is more important than the power we wield. -Mordred, Season Five: Arthur’s Bane Part Two</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBWbU5BvA0o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBWbU5BvA0o</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">-Whitney</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Star Trek: TOS</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have not seen this series,  you have been living under a rock. While it was canceled after its third season back in the 60’s, it became a cult classic, resulting in five spin-off TV series, two movies set in an alternate timeline and 10 original movies. The series follows Captain Kirk,  Mr. Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and other memorable crew members of the starship Enterprise as they explore the galaxy and new civilizations. Star Trek has well-formed characters and original plotlines that really make you think- something that really sets it apart. If you have not seen Star Trek, why are you still reading this? Go and catch up on what you have been missing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">You may find that having is so pleasing a thing as wanting. This is not logical, but often true.-Mr. Spock, Amok Time</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8bY619HLQc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8bY619HLQc</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">-Whitney</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Pretty Little Liars</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s getting intense for all those PLL fanatics. A’s identity is close to being  revealed. In this TV drama/ thriller, four friends come together to discover an anonymous enemy who threatens the safety of all their darkest secrets, masking itself as A. Throughout this series, these friends come close to unraveling their best friend Alison DiLarentis&#8217; murder, while on many occasions, they come close to their own demise. Lately, it&#8217;s hard to know who’s telling the truth and who isn&#8217;t, who’s in cahoots with A and who’s not. Secrets are coming out and relationships are being tested, while lines are being crossed and mysteries are bubbling to the surface. This TV mystery definitely keeps you at the edge of your seat. You never know who’s next on A’s list.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The rich girls steal, the pretty girls lie, the smart girls play dumb and the dumb girls spend their days trying to be all of the above.&#8221; &#8211; Caleb, Season Three: Episode 14.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trailer:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOXKM7eImSY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOXKM7eImSY</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">-Allison</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-The Walking Dead</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on a comic book series by Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead  follows a group of humans on the run in Georgia after a zombie apocalypse. Something that makes the series unique is that  the The Walking Dead focuses on human nature and portrays it very accurately. It shows a side of people only brought out by the worst of times. Characters develop beautifully if not always the way we want them to, but insanity is made to be beautiful through the story and excellent writing” instead of the cut-zombies-in-two approach. While the show doesn’t exactly have a consistent cast of characters, there are quite a few fan favorites, which says something about the writers: they can consistently come up with good and complex characters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote: You are going to beat this world, I know you will. You are smart, and you are strong, and you are so brave, and I love you. You gotta do what&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s so easy to do the wrong thing in this world. So, so, if it feels wrong don&#8217;t do it, alright? If it feels easy don&#8217;t do it, don&#8217;t let this world spoil you. -Lori,  Season Three: Killer Within</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSi2fJALDyQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSi2fJALDyQ</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">-Whitney</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">-Sherlock</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sherlock is a mini-series based on the short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle.  The series is set in modern-day London, and features the iconic duo of Sherlock Holmes and Captain John Watson chasing criminals, solving cases, getting themselves into the weirdest situations (showing up in Buckingham palace in a bedsheet) and unraveling the mystery that is professor Moriarty. The series is hilarious, there are memorable one-liners, fantastic actors,  incredibly twisted plots and  horrifying season finales. All in all, Sherlock is something that can appeal to anyone and everyone, including me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Listen, John what I said before, I meant it. I don’t have friends. I’ve just got one. –Sherlock Holmes, Season Two: The Hounds of Baskerville</p>

<p dir="ltr">-Whitney</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Breaking Bad</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chemistry teacher Walter White has a normal life. He lives in the quiet town of Albuquerque New Mexico with his wife and his 15 year old son. He has a nice job as a high school chemistry teacher. And with a baby on the way, everything seems great.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When he finds out he has lung cancer, he&#8217;s devastated. What will happen when he dies? How will his family survive without him? How can he make money for his family? What should a chemistry teacher do?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sell drugs, obviously.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the help of one of his former students, Jesse, they cook and sell pure crystal meth. He must hide his secret from his family and especially his brother-in-law, who happens to be a DEA agent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Breaking Bad has 5 seasons and each season has about 12 episodes. It has ended but you can watch it on AMC or on Netflix.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I have spent my whole life scared, frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen, 50-years I spent like that. Finding myself awake at three in the morning. But you know what? Ever since my diagnosis, I sleep just fine. What I came to realize is that fear, that’s the worst of it. That’s the real enemy. So, get up, get out in the real world and you kick that bastard as hard you can right in the teeth.” &#8211; Walter White</p>
<p>-Jordan McCoy</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Supernatural</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hunting demons is all a part of the family business for Dean and Sam Winchester.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When they were younger, Sam and Dean’s mother was killed by a demon. Shortly after, their house burns down. Their dad, heartbroken, becomes a “hunter,” a person who hunts demons and monsters, in order to find the demon that killed his wife and his sons’ mother. He also teaches his 8 and 6-year-old sons how to hunt demons. Years after their mother&#8217;s death, Sam leaves his family to become a lawyer. Dean stays with his dad and continues hunting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">20 years after their mother&#8217;s death, Dean visits Sam at college and tells him that he hasn&#8217;t heard from their dad in a few weeks and he thinks he’s been a hunting accident. Sam reluctantly comes along to help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Supernatural is currently on its 9th season and it can be viewed on the CW Channel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote-</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What kind of a house doesn&#8217;t have salt? Low sodium freaks!”-Dean</p>
<p dir="ltr">-Jordan McCoy</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-New Girl</p>
<p>After not-so-patient waiting, the second season has finally arrived on Netflix. In this comedic TV series, Jess, a quirky school teacher who is known to spontaneously burst into song, finds herself moving into a loft with three guys she came across on Craigslist: Nick, a bartender who dropped out of law school; Schmidt, a flashy personality who believes he&#8217;s a god and has been placed on the earth as a gift to women; and Winston, a former athlete who just has no idea what he&#8217;s going to do with his life. This dysfunctional group of friends are always there for one another, helping each other in their darkest and stupidest moments. While living under the same roof, relationships get complicated and jumbled. In the end, however, they are the true definition of a family. This TV series absolutely brings a little sunshine and laughter to your day; its hard to stop watching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I could pretend to be more like you, Jess, and live on a sparkly rainbow and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time.&#8221; &#8211; Nick, Season 1: Episode 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 11, 2013, the Syfy channel released its new original movie, Sharknado. This movie was very helpful in dealing with a Sharknado, if you ever have the opportunity of experiencing one. Without a doubt this was one of the best movies of 2013 and deserves an Oscar for both acting and animation.</p>
<p>That’s what I would say if Syfy was paying me to do this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sharknado wasn&#8217;t Syfy’s finest movie. Along with a lot of puns and horrible CGI sharks, you&#8217;re pretty much wasting an evening. Ian Ziering, who was also in the TV show Beverly Hills 90210, plays our hero Fin Shepard (the hero’s name is Fin, and this is a movie about sharks- this is very fishy), the owner of a popular bar. With the help of his ex-wife and his bar employees, they speed around Los Angeles trying to save people from the dreaded flying sharks and also robbing convenience stores for their guns and chainsaws along the way. I don&#8217;t want to spoil the ending for you, but let’s just say that thanks to this movie we now know how to stop a Sharknado. Thanks Syfy!</p>
<p dir="ltr">The premiere of Sharknado gained around 2.1 million views and over 5,000 tweets per minute on Twitter. That’s a lot of hype for a poorly made movie. Thanks to all the views, Syfy has announced that they will be making a sequel. With the help of Twitter, the title  for the sequel is Sharknado 2: The Second One. They plan on releasing it next summer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite how amazingly bad it is, you should watch it at least once. It’s a cult classic. Sharknado has been released on DVD and is still currently being replayed on the Syfy channel. Who knows? Maybe this movie will come in handy someday when we experience our own Sharknado.</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Side note: I actually love this movie and I’m just poking fun at its mistakes. It’s a really great movie and I really think that you should watch it.)</p>
