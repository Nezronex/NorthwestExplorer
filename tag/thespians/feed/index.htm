										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">On Jan. 9, 10, and 11, Northwest Thespians attended the Thespian Conference at the Hyatt and Century II.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Thespian Conference was quite the experience, according to head of the drama department Richard Lundin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Workshops, full length plays, musicals, one-acts, college representatives, theatre auditions, technical auditions and competitions, and a chance to communicate with professionals from the industry on all levels helped make this a truly theatrical experience,” Lundin said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The conference is an exclusive one. Only Thespians can attend, and the requirements for becoming a thespian are pretty steep.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Theatre students can become a Thespian only after participating in drama events&#8211;whether it be being involved in stage craft, tech crew, being a part of the cast list, etc. They must then undergo an interviewing and selection process conducted by the Thespian officers and sponsors.</p>
<p>The select group of Thespians look forward to attending the next conference.</p>
