										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conjoined lunches are new to returning Northwest students and have sparked a little concern throughout the school. Some students are worried about Covid spreading, not enough places to sit, and the long lunch lines. Cooper Schmitz, a junior, is one of many that agree with this.</p>
<p>“It’s weird. It’s a love-hate thing because there are too many people and it gets crowded. It’s also impossible to make a turn out of the school when I want to go somewhere,” Schmitz said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the downsides to the conjoined lunch, there are always ups. Freshman Aaliyah Clark likes the conjoined lunch.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a great way for people to socialize with all the upperclassmen. I also think that it is really crowded, there are always seats taken, and the lunch line is exceedingly long, and waiting in it is just a waste of time,” Clark said.</p>
<p>Many more students at Northwest can agree that the conjoined lunch isn’t the best because of the lack of seats and not enough time to get your lunch and eat it. Overall, they are many ups and downs that the conjoined lunch has brought to Northwest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to Covid-19 people are required to wear mask in a public place. There are still people who refuse to wear a mask in the store. It’s a requirement but every once and a while you&#8217;ll see people without a mask. Do they have a point to not wear one? What should happen to them? Is there other things mask can do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a requirement to wear masks in public whether someone’s at a gas station, the store, or a restaurant. Mask may not make a person immune to Covid-19 but it helps lower the risk of them getting it. It helps keep people safe and healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people who don’t wear mask when they are supposed to I feel like there should be proper action taken. I feel if someone doesn’t wear a mask in a public place, anyone who works there should ask them calmly to wear a mask or leave. If they refuse to leave they should be denied service. Now if someone starts causing a huge scene the worker should just leave them alone to stop any possible physical confrontation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who don’t wear mask should really look at the unnecessary trouble they are causing. For the thirty minuets of wearing a mask in a store isn’t bad if its helping keep people safe from the pandemic. Wearing a mask is not only helping you but others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask can do more than help keep you safe from a pandemic. Mask can help keep your face warm in the winter. Little kids who have allergies don’t quite understand how important it is to sneeze in your arm or tissue. So wearing a mask can help block that sneeze. Wearing a mask can help in so many different ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask is important and if people refuse to there should be proper precautions taken.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>In early November the United States became the first nation to see more than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases reported in a single day.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&nbsp; wide variety of people who don&#8217;t get symptoms make being out in public potentially dangerous for people With the holidays approaching, people have the urge to travel and visit family. The White House throughout the pandemic has continued to downplay the threat so people worry less, leading to numbers rising.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important Facts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers say the pandemic is responsible for roughly 1,000 fatalities per day, six times the average daily toll from the worst influenza season in the past decade</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s known that 20% to 40% of those infected are thought to be asymptomatic – they never exhibit any symptoms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel by bussing is something to avoid, they are considered high risk and are COVID transmission hot spots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking to travel, going by plane is the safest route. Planes have turbo-charged ventilation systems. Cars are also safer and an alternative when visiting people for Christmas and New Years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of personal protective equipment remains a chronic problem, especially in hot spots for the virus</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel is risky and unsafe right now but when looking for an option to get from place to place airplanes are the safest option for public transportation. Planes have a system installed to prevent recycled air from entering the cabin and potentially exposing others to the virus.&nbsp; Several airlines also instilled strict mask-wearing mandates and some require temperature checks and negative COVID test results before allowing passengers to board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the ending of November is when Kansas got hit the worst with a total of 7,497 confirmed cases. This was confirmed on November 23. As of December, the reports of positive tests have been in the 4,000s in the area. The reason for explaining the COVID-19 scores isn&#8217;t to scare people; it is simply to spread awareness of the current crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is key to note that America’s 60 million rural residents are older. Many of these older members of the community are diagnosed with chronic health problems at higher rates than the national average. It is important to understand that these older people are considered more at risk from the virus. Getting a COVID test to make sure you are negative before seeing people will end up being the best bet for keeping yourself and other people safe. False negatives are common though, and it&#8217;s no guarantee that you or anyone you know that might be traveling aren&#8217;t contagious. No matter what precautions you take a large number of gatherings have turned into spreader events because people who tested assumed it was safe to be in a large group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about other people and not just yourself is something that has the possibility to be life-saving. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Christmas less than a month away, people of all ages are starting up their annual Christmas traditions. Whether it’s with family, friends or significant others, seemingly everyone has some sort of holiday tradition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Hofhine spends her time bonding with her siblings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every Christmas Eve, me and my little siblings build a tent out of blankets and sheets and whatever we can find,” Hofhine said. “We put lights up around it in the living room and we all sleep in the tent.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to hanging out with siblings, Ameara Clark gets to visit another relative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I go to my aunt’s house on Christmas Eve every year,” Clark said. “She’ll make a big dinner (I get a WHOLE pan of green bean casserole for myself) and we&#8217;ll trade white elephant gifts and eat cake balls.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesley Buser also has exciting traditions involving food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In normal years, my grandma holds a gingerbread house decorating party with homemade houses, cookies, sandwiches, soups, and then holiday ice cream,” Buser said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America isn’t the only one with Christmas traditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British kids are well acquainted with Father Christmas, Santa Claus or Saint Nick, but they can consider themselves lucky they don&#8217;t live in Austria, where a ghoulish creature called &#8216;Krampus&#8217;, the evil accomplice of St Nicholas, is said to wander the streets in search of badly-behaved children. During the month of December you can expect to see terrifying masked figures out and about scaring kids and adults alike with ghastly pranks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unusual tradition comes from Iceland, where a giant cat is said to roam the snowy countryside at Christmas time. Traditionally farmers would use the Yule Cat as an incentive for their workers &#8211; those who worked hard would receive a new set of clothes, but those who didn&#8217;t would be devoured by the gigantic cat-like beast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this year, most cannot celebrate Christmas like they’re used to, because of Covid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how the Coronavirus has impacted Chesley Buser’s Christmas traditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So my grandpa&#8217;s birthday is Christmas Eve and we normally have a bunch of parties to celebrate him and of course Christmas,&#8221; Buser said &#8220;We have a bunch of my family come down but this year it will just be my immediate family of me, my sister, mom, dad, mama, and papa. It will definitely be smaller but I hope that by next year things will be better,&#8221; Buser said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covid-19 cases are on the rise once again. Things that people need to fulfill their basic needs are flying off the shelves. People are starting stock up in fear of another shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limits are slowly starting to be put into to the works. Limits are starting to be put on toilet paper and paper towels where you can only buy one of each. Things like beef, pork, and chicken are starting to have limits as well. Slowly soda is starting to get limits at Dillon&#8217;s and Sam&#8217;s.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toilet paper is flying off the shelves like it did earlier in the year. Stores like Walmart, Dillon&#8217;s, and Costco are stocked with plenty of toilet paper in variety of brands. Sam&#8217;s on the other hand are struggling to keep toilet paper on the shelves. Once toilet paper is put on the shelves it’s gone within minuets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canned food like beans, fruits, vegetables, and soup are almost impossible to find on a daily basis. Throughout the week it gets harder to find can food. It’s better to go get canned food on days a store stocks so you have a better selection before things start to disappear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not soda is getting harder to find during the pandemic. Popular brands like Pepsi, Coke, and Sprite are getting harder to find at stores like Costco and Sam&#8217;s. Stores like Walmart and Dillon&#8217;s are stocked on the popular brands but non popular brands like lemonade are almost impossible to get your hands on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of materials to fulfill basic needs are one of the many problems that Covid-19 has caused.&nbsp;</span></p>
