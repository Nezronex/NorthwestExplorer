										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 11, 2013, the Syfy channel released its new original movie, Sharknado. This movie was very helpful in dealing with a Sharknado, if you ever have the opportunity of experiencing one. Without a doubt this was one of the best movies of 2013 and deserves an Oscar for both acting and animation.</p>
<p>That’s what I would say if Syfy was paying me to do this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sharknado wasn&#8217;t Syfy’s finest movie. Along with a lot of puns and horrible CGI sharks, you&#8217;re pretty much wasting an evening. Ian Ziering, who was also in the TV show Beverly Hills 90210, plays our hero Fin Shepard (the hero’s name is Fin, and this is a movie about sharks- this is very fishy), the owner of a popular bar. With the help of his ex-wife and his bar employees, they speed around Los Angeles trying to save people from the dreaded flying sharks and also robbing convenience stores for their guns and chainsaws along the way. I don&#8217;t want to spoil the ending for you, but let’s just say that thanks to this movie we now know how to stop a Sharknado. Thanks Syfy!</p>
<p dir="ltr">The premiere of Sharknado gained around 2.1 million views and over 5,000 tweets per minute on Twitter. That’s a lot of hype for a poorly made movie. Thanks to all the views, Syfy has announced that they will be making a sequel. With the help of Twitter, the title  for the sequel is Sharknado 2: The Second One. They plan on releasing it next summer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite how amazingly bad it is, you should watch it at least once. It’s a cult classic. Sharknado has been released on DVD and is still currently being replayed on the Syfy channel. Who knows? Maybe this movie will come in handy someday when we experience our own Sharknado.</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Side note: I actually love this movie and I’m just poking fun at its mistakes. It’s a really great movie and I really think that you should watch it.)</p>
