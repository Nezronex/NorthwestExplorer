										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepping for college applications or making the dream sports team may be the next step for some after high school. Some students are not aware of the effect their online presence can have on their college plans.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students’ social media outputs can influence admission counselors or coaches to decline or revoke a scholarship because of what students  post on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook. According to Kaplan Test Prep’s 2013 Survey, 30 percent of college admissions officers found something online about an applicant that negatively affected their application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why college career coordinator Danea Cramer cautions against posting questionable material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you&#8217;re saying you are one thing on an application and then on social media you&#8217;re being inappropriate,” Cramer said “[colleges] probably won’t give that money to you because you&#8217;re not putting yourself in a very good light,” college career coordinator Danea Cramer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Northwest, head basketball coach Bryan Chadwick has a Twitter for the basketball team where coaches could have access to a player’s social media account. They will soon have an Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are just being smart, being proactive because you don&#8217;t want that stuff to catch up with you,” Chadwick said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For head football coach Steve Martin, reviewing a student&#8217;s account can occur when someone brings attention the the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those people and myself are looking at their profiles. I have had a parent or another teacher that follows a kid and says ‘hey coach, you might wanna look what this guy has on his profile’,” Martin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been parents that have brought attention to what their child or other student&#8217;s post. Online material considered inappropriate can range from violent to offensive posts or in relation of abusing drugs or alcohol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a strict drug policy here at Northwest when it comes to athletics,” Martin said. “Maybe they might not be a drug user or some of their friends might be, one of the big things is that they tie themselves into it just to try to be cool.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These actions affect everyone in other colleges around the U.S also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have seen it on ESPN  where college coaches have taken away scholarships. There was a kid out of Michigan. There was a kid out of Arkansas.They don’t want character issues,” Chadwick said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chadwick’s assertion is true. In 2012, football player Yuri Wright was expelled from Don Bosco Prep high School in Ramsey, N.J.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of racial and sexually graphic Twitter posts. He also lost  his scholarship to Michigan University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Putting a thought or feeling out there for everyone to see can lead to huge consequences. Junior Samantha Gould has found this out the hard way where she would soon learn to think about posting every thought or feeling on the internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would turn into a huge mess, Gould said. “I drifted away from a lot of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General admission for colleges sometimes do not look into students social media accounts.They just look to see if that student meets criteria, but if they are applying for a private college or a scholarship, they can choose to look up that student to see what they are posting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scholarship money is a gift,” Cramer said. “It&#8217;s nothing you have to pay back. So that can be anywhere from $250 to $2000 or more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin warns against risking this gift for likes or retweets, because mistakes online can be irreversible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Internet is a dictionary,” Martin said. “It&#8217;s an encyclopedia of your past.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ALS ice bucket challenge has been the latest viral trend, spreading awareness and shivering bodies around the world. The gist of the ice bucket challenge is to either donate $100 to ALS research or only donate $10 along with dumping a bucket of ice water onto your head. Many people throughout our school have accepted the challenge, but very few actually know what the disease is.</p>
<p>According to alsa.org, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a degenerative muscle disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The disease attacks the motor neurons, and slowly makes it impossible to initiate and control muscle movement by stopping the impulses sent to tell muscle fibers to move. This results in the muscles becoming weak and smaller, since they are starving from their motor impulse diet. The muscles that are affected control voluntary movements and muscle power, so any movement that you tell your brain to make you do is hindered.</p>
<p>Imagine a life without being able to reach for your morning cup of coffee, no matter how hard you grasp.</p>
<p>Imagine a life where you can’t take a deep breath of your surroundings, no matter how hard you gasp.</p>
<p>Imagine a life where you were unable to stop or start your muscles, no matter how hard you try.</p>
<p>There is no definite reason that can explain why these signals are cut off from the muscles, and there is no cure that can halt or reverse the symptoms of ALS. There are some experimental drugs, therapies, and devices that can help manage the symptoms, but the outcome is always the same. The disease ultimately leads to death.</p>
<p>Around 5,600 people in the United States are diagnosed with ALS each year, and the life expectancy is only 2 to 5 years after diagnosis. ALS is not a biased disease, it will attack anyone at any time. There is no racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic perimeters.</p>
<p>Individuals with ALS made the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge popular, and it is very influential in the ALS community. All of the proceeds are donated to different researches, along with services that help offer education, awareness, and care services for people that are affected with ALS.</p>
<p>When you dump a bucket of freezing water on your head and donate the $10 rather than $100, you are helping save the individuals who struggle daily with ALS. You are helping in the race against time for a way to stop the disease. You are making a difference.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Internet has pretty much become our number one source of anything. We communicate through our iPhones and smart phones more than we talk to people face to face. The dangers of hacking and identity theft have become so much more relevant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I probably won’t ever be hacked, nothing like that happens to me. Says every person ever.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Social networks are great, sure. They help us connect with old friends, send funny photos, and just be able to talk to friends in the spur of the moment- anywhere, anytime. Having that availability at the tip of our fingers is incredibly convenient, so it is needless to say we use that to our advantage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People are so caught up in the hype of social networks that no one ever reads the terms and policies anymore. We just assume because everyone has an account, it’s safe. So we just freely give our personal information to the company and start snapping those chats, or posting a picture on Instagram with little to no thought about where it’s going or how it’s being used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take Snapchat for instance. Their big seller is the fact that once a picture is sent, it is deleted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“&#8230;making communication between any two parties fleeting, with no record left of the content, within the constraints of modern technology,” said Snapchat on their terms and policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notice the part, “within the constraints of modern technology”. So basically they’re saying that it most likely won’t get deleted. Everything you put on the Internet within “modern technology” is permanently there, you just can’t always see it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So before you accept to a media network’s terms, read between the lines a little, because that’s where all their secrets lie. Don’t think just because you hide something on the Internet it can’t be accessed, because once you put it on there it’s never going to truly go away. There are some insanely genius people out there who hack your “hidden” stuff for a hobby.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you feel a bit on edge when it comes to  a social network’s terms, do some research first. You’d be surprised what you’ll find.</p>
<p>After all, you can find anything on the Internet.</p>
