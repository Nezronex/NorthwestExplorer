										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>In early November the United States became the first nation to see more than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases reported in a single day.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&nbsp; wide variety of people who don&#8217;t get symptoms make being out in public potentially dangerous for people With the holidays approaching, people have the urge to travel and visit family. The White House throughout the pandemic has continued to downplay the threat so people worry less, leading to numbers rising.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important Facts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers say the pandemic is responsible for roughly 1,000 fatalities per day, six times the average daily toll from the worst influenza season in the past decade</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s known that 20% to 40% of those infected are thought to be asymptomatic – they never exhibit any symptoms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel by bussing is something to avoid, they are considered high risk and are COVID transmission hot spots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking to travel, going by plane is the safest route. Planes have turbo-charged ventilation systems. Cars are also safer and an alternative when visiting people for Christmas and New Years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of personal protective equipment remains a chronic problem, especially in hot spots for the virus</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel is risky and unsafe right now but when looking for an option to get from place to place airplanes are the safest option for public transportation. Planes have a system installed to prevent recycled air from entering the cabin and potentially exposing others to the virus.&nbsp; Several airlines also instilled strict mask-wearing mandates and some require temperature checks and negative COVID test results before allowing passengers to board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the ending of November is when Kansas got hit the worst with a total of 7,497 confirmed cases. This was confirmed on November 23. As of December, the reports of positive tests have been in the 4,000s in the area. The reason for explaining the COVID-19 scores isn&#8217;t to scare people; it is simply to spread awareness of the current crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is key to note that America’s 60 million rural residents are older. Many of these older members of the community are diagnosed with chronic health problems at higher rates than the national average. It is important to understand that these older people are considered more at risk from the virus. Getting a COVID test to make sure you are negative before seeing people will end up being the best bet for keeping yourself and other people safe. False negatives are common though, and it&#8217;s no guarantee that you or anyone you know that might be traveling aren&#8217;t contagious. No matter what precautions you take a large number of gatherings have turned into spreader events because people who tested assumed it was safe to be in a large group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about other people and not just yourself is something that has the possibility to be life-saving. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unique culture, interesting laws, difference in food and language, makes other countries much more fascinating than the United States to most people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many places you see in books and read in stories that &nbsp;you have to see with your eyes to really appreciate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler Grommesh, a senior, talks about the three different countries he has visited in Europe with a group from school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cities we stayed in and the countries we visited included Dublin, Ireland, London, England and Paris, France.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tyler explained his favorite part of the was how rich each culture was and their overall diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many places to visit, but Tyler picked out his favorite sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My favorite bit would have to be the drive through the Welsh countryside. The views of the mountains and the sea were just the most spectacular thing you would ever see.” Grommesh said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is such a great opportunity to go outside the country, according to Tyler Grommesh, “You are always told that these places are out there and [that] they have harbored human civilization for a millennial,” said Grommesh. He was astounded about seeing these places in person verses in the pages of a text book. Seeing these attractions and stepping onto new soil for the first time made everything feel surreal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the more interesting landmarks and places he has visited include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Book of Kells in Ireland, the Welsh Castle, Tower Bridge and Buckingham Palace in London, Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was, inevitably, some flaws in the trip, “I don’t think I would go back to France simply because of how dangerous, dirty, and cramped it was,” said Grommesh. He shared a story about how a girl was forced to pay for something that the vender forcefully put on her arm. They were even warned about people who would pickpocket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on Tyler Grommesh’s comments no matter the flaws it is crucial to visit different countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t honestly recommend going out of the country enough,” said Grommesh. “Even if you don’t think you can afford it, you should try to visit other countries especially in Europe at some point in your life.”&nbsp;</span></p>
