										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Journalism students found out Tuesday that they placed 2nd in the Kansas State Fair’s Scholastic Press Corps competition held Sept. 11 in Hutchinson.</p>
<p>Eighteen teams competed in the contest. Northwest’s print team won $50 for being the Reserve Grand Champion.</p>
<p>When the group arrived at the fair around 8 a.m, they set up their equipment and were given until 6 p.m. to make the four page newsletter. The newsletter, named the “Meadowlark Messenger” contained four stories and photos covering activities and attractions at the fair.</p>
<p>“It was intense and down to the wire, but I still had fun,” junior Emily Dulohery said.</p>
<p>Every moment was used to interview, take photos,and design the newsletter.</p>
<p>”The room got a little chaotic towards the end, but I know that they gave it their all; blood, sweat, and tears were put into our publication,” journalism teacher Rebekah Morse said.</p>
<p>The newsletter consisted of topics including a bedazzled bra contest, chicken baths, a talking robot and the dare devil high dive.</p>
<p>Judges rated the publications on design, content, and photography.</p>
<p>“It was 5:59, and the deadline was 6 p.m., so we saved everything to the flashdrive and I had to sprint to the judge’s table to make it in time,” senior Cody Kretchmar said.</p>
<p>In addition to Dulohery and Kretchmar, print team members included seniors Taylor Allen and Madison McCollum.</p>
<p>Video team members included juniors Mira Smith, Tatum Sturdivant, Grace Wilkinson, senior Jozabeth Garcia and sophomore Jordan Coss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest High School journalism students were inducted into Quill and Scroll International Honorary Society on Thursday, Oct. 17. Being inducted into Quill and Scroll is an honor for selected students every year district-wide who have been in journalism for a year, have a 3.0 GPA, and have contributed in some way to the newspaper or yearbook.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it’s a great way to recognize my students who work really hard to put out their publications,” journalism teacher Rebekah Morse said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the induction all inductees are brought up on stage and announced by their adviser. Each inductee receives a pin and cords to wear at graduation. Guest speaker Lily Wu from KAKE News came and spoke to the inductees and their families and gave tips on careers in journalism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other high schools with students inducted that night include East, Eisenhower, Goddard, Heights, North, South, Southeast, and West.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These kids spend a lot of their time trying to make sure everything is up to date and care a lot about what they’re doing,” Morse said.</p>
<p>Benefits to being inducted are being in an honorary society and building resumes. Morse would like to build Quill and Scroll up and start doing community service in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">On Friday, Sept. 13, journalism teacher Rebekah Morse took five Northwest students to the Kansas State Fair for the Kansas State Fair Scholastic Press Corps Print Competition. The purpose of the contest was to print, interview, write stories, take photos, and then design a four-page newsletter.</p>
<p> The competition started at 8 a.m. and lasted all day until 6 p.m., which was the final deadline. Judging took place over the weekend. The schools will be contacted with the results.</p>
<p>The students who went were sophomores Haley Cooper and Emily Dulohery and seniors Lyndi McIntyre, Kira Crafton and Grace Buckingham.</p>
<p>“Even if we don’t place, I’m still glad we went,” says Morse, “it was a nice way to get out of the school setting and report on something different, and show our true skills.”</p>
<p>It was a fairly nice day, no pun intended. The weather was in the mid-70’s. The day started out really slow and got more busy as the day went on.</p>
<p>Sophomore Haley Cooper covered and wrote about the 4H Horse Show.</p>
<p>“It was a good experience,” Cooper said. “It was a very real world application of reporting. I feel like we did a good job.”</p>
