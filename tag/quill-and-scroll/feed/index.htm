										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest High School journalism students were inducted into Quill and Scroll International Honorary Society on Thursday, Oct. 17. Being inducted into Quill and Scroll is an honor for selected students every year district-wide who have been in journalism for a year, have a 3.0 GPA, and have contributed in some way to the newspaper or yearbook.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it’s a great way to recognize my students who work really hard to put out their publications,” journalism teacher Rebekah Morse said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the induction all inductees are brought up on stage and announced by their adviser. Each inductee receives a pin and cords to wear at graduation. Guest speaker Lily Wu from KAKE News came and spoke to the inductees and their families and gave tips on careers in journalism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other high schools with students inducted that night include East, Eisenhower, Goddard, Heights, North, South, Southeast, and West.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These kids spend a lot of their time trying to make sure everything is up to date and care a lot about what they’re doing,” Morse said.</p>
<p>Benefits to being inducted are being in an honorary society and building resumes. Morse would like to build Quill and Scroll up and start doing community service in the future.</p>
