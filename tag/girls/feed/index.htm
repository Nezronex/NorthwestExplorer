										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Northwest girls basketball team had a sad ending to their season of hard work that left them emotional on Wed. March 5. The team lost to Garden City in a 66-40 game, resulting in them being eliminated from qualifying for state.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At the beginning we were working really hard and doing well holding them, but they went on a run of points and we couldn’t stop them,” said sophomore Haley Cooper. At halftime the score 29-12 Garden City.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We went from a run of 8-0 at the beginning of the game to that, it was a little disappointing,” said Cooper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The game was played in Garden City, so the team had to stay after the loss to watch the Northwest boys play, who also had a tragic 3 point loss.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We were trying to be supportive of the guys during their game but when we got back into the locker room it was very emotional since it was the seniors last game,” said Cooper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team finished with a 9-12 record.</p>
<p>“Ultimately it would have been nice to have a happier ending, but it was a good experience, despite it all we functioned as a team unit and were supportive the whole season,” said Cooper.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Northwest girls won their first game 53-33 against North on Dec. 6, and demolished West in their second game  with a 67-21 score on Dec. 10.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s always a great experience,” sophomore Shaunece Grant said on her first year playing with the varsity team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The girls have started off great so far and are improving in their practices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So far as a team we have gotten better each game, so I hope that continues,” Grant said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve been turning the ball over a lot so we have been focusing on keeping the ball in practice, I think our hard work will pay off in our next game against South,” sophomore Haley Cooper said.</p>
<p>Their next game is on Tuesday, Dec. 17 at home against South.</p>
