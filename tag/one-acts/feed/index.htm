<p dir="ltr">Upon attending the second night of one acts on Saturday, Nov. 23, this is the thought that crossed my mind.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The student-directed (and sometimes student-written) one acts featured students, who were mostly freshmen and sophomores, who performed skits that lasted around 20 minutes each.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Each performance was absolutely hysterical. “The Real Problem,” which was directed by junior Elizabeth Kramer, had me in tears.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Countless evenings spent in rehearsal, hours spent memorizing lines, innumerable adjustments made to lighting and sound, and more was devoted to making the one acts a success. And indeed, a success it was.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So while I’m enjoying my evening filled with laughter, I find myself wondering: Why aren’t there more people here?</p>
<p>Time after time, theatre productions leave me in awe. Personally, I think students who aren’t at these drama events are missing out.</p>
