										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">On Feb. 15 sophomores Chris Kliewer, Marie Altgilbers, and Emily Dulohery and seniors Josue Quintana, Taryn Powers, and Kylie Norton competed in the state Scholars Bowl tournament. Out of 8 teams the Northwest team came in last. However, this is the first time in at least 11 years that Northwest has qualified for state. It doesn’t take much to be a part of Scholars Bowl.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Scholars Bowl is a team of academically talented students, and we go to tournaments, and we answer questions about lots of topics,” said Dulohery.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anyone is welcome to join Scholars Bowl; there are no tryouts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It takes a lot of practice to make it to state. The questions are harder, and it’s a difficult challenge for the Northwest team. The Northwest team practiced once a week, and ate lots of pizza. Although the team was disappointed in the results, they were happy they made it, and enjoyed the day.</p>
