										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warning: Bring a life jacket.</p>
<p><i>If I Stay</i>, a film starring Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley, is an unconventional love story about a cellist and a rock star whose love is put under strain by a life disaster. Mia (Chloe Grace) and her family were in a brutal car crash that left her in a comma and the rest of her family dead. The movie is based off the idea that your destiny is what you choose. She is able to hear and see everything that goes on around her unresponsive body, and is left to make the choice to move on or to stay alive.</p>
<p>The movie was based off of the novel by Gayle Forman, and stuck closely to the plot of the book. Since <i>If I Stay </i>is one of my favorite books, I rushed to see it in film. There’s something about seeing the emotion play out on screen that hits you harder than any printed words could. This movie shows the raw emotion of family, friends, and personal struggles that come from a major life change, such as death. The sorrow and passion hits you like a brick to the face. If you go see this movie and have anything short of a heart of ice, you will be in tears. If you are anything like me, you will need a life jacket to swim out of your tears.</p>
<p>This movie is a must see for the season. Whether you are in need of a good cry, or just want to torture your sappy significant other, this movie will give you your sentimental fix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 11, 2013, the Syfy channel released its new original movie, Sharknado. This movie was very helpful in dealing with a Sharknado, if you ever have the opportunity of experiencing one. Without a doubt this was one of the best movies of 2013 and deserves an Oscar for both acting and animation.</p>
<p>That’s what I would say if Syfy was paying me to do this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sharknado wasn&#8217;t Syfy’s finest movie. Along with a lot of puns and horrible CGI sharks, you&#8217;re pretty much wasting an evening. Ian Ziering, who was also in the TV show Beverly Hills 90210, plays our hero Fin Shepard (the hero’s name is Fin, and this is a movie about sharks- this is very fishy), the owner of a popular bar. With the help of his ex-wife and his bar employees, they speed around Los Angeles trying to save people from the dreaded flying sharks and also robbing convenience stores for their guns and chainsaws along the way. I don&#8217;t want to spoil the ending for you, but let’s just say that thanks to this movie we now know how to stop a Sharknado. Thanks Syfy!</p>
<p dir="ltr">The premiere of Sharknado gained around 2.1 million views and over 5,000 tweets per minute on Twitter. That’s a lot of hype for a poorly made movie. Thanks to all the views, Syfy has announced that they will be making a sequel. With the help of Twitter, the title  for the sequel is Sharknado 2: The Second One. They plan on releasing it next summer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite how amazingly bad it is, you should watch it at least once. It’s a cult classic. Sharknado has been released on DVD and is still currently being replayed on the Syfy channel. Who knows? Maybe this movie will come in handy someday when we experience our own Sharknado.</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Side note: I actually love this movie and I’m just poking fun at its mistakes. It’s a really great movie and I really think that you should watch it.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 7th movie in the Harry Potter series is probably the movie with the highest expectations by far. The previous movie ended in the middle of the action and excitement, and Deathly Hallows picked it right back up. Shortly after the curtains went up, the curses were flying though the air and people were falling off their broomsticks. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) along with his loyal friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), continue what Dumbledore started. The trio tries to find the horcruxes, objects that make Voldemort immortal. Once the horcruxes are destroyed the three will be able to kill Voldemort once and for all. But Voldemort is not going to make it easy for them.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord&#8217;s power is growing stronger every day. One of Voldemort’s followers gets announced to the new Minister of Magic. The ministry puts up &#8220;Wanted” posters with big rewards for whoever catches Harry. So he hides and cannot show himself to the public and can’t trust anyone but his closest friends. After Harry’s principal, mentor and good friend Dumbledore died, he left small clues to the next horcruxes, leaving Harry and his friends to figure it out.</p>
<p>They spend most of their days in a tent in the forest and get their friendship tested. The romance between Ron and Hermione keeps appearing, but as Hermione and Harry spend a lot of time together, Ron starts to get very jealous.</p>
<p>Even though this may sound cliché for some audiences, the movie (that lasts for almost 2 and a half hours) has a lot of action, combined with romance, friendship and mystery. The last few movies have missed many important scenes from the books, making it hard to follow and understand the magic world J.K. Rowling created. This time, director David Yates decided to split the book in two movies and made sure to tell the whole story. But why didn&#8217;t he think of this earlier? Having read the book, seeing many of the scenes from the book also in the movie was pleasant. But I also believe it makes for a better movie for those who haven’t read the book. All over, this was a very good movie and I can&#8217;t wait for the second part.</p>
