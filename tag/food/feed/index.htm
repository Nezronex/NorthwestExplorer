										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pie Five is a pizzeria located on S. Ridge Rd, next to Lowes and Applebees; and I have to say that I was fairly impressed. The walk in was extremely similar to Chipotle’s, and the wait was just as long. Walking in, there is a long walkway towards the left and forward to the order area. i felt relaxed, the opposite feeling you get at a sports bar. I could relax, and have quiet conversation with my friend.  </p>
<p>Seating was like your typical Chipotle setup, but with more crimson, grey and white opposed to Chipotle’s maroon and brick red. The cool, calm environment gave me the opportunity to focus on my food and friend.</p>
<p>At the counter, you select how you want your pizza. From all the cheeses, different meat and vegetables toppings; the true definition of personal panned. Contrast to the stereotypical pizza, the crust here was quite doughy. The meat on it was crafted to crispiness, and the cheese melted into the sauce like ice cream in the summer. The pizza was so life changing, I had an epiphany every bite. I’d rate the pizzeria at a 4 out of 5 stars, based off of the pizza service, and restaurant comfortability. I’d definitely recommend it for anyone searching for that “next level” of pizza. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since last year, students have worried about food sales at school because of changing nutrition guidelines. One of students’ primary concerns has been Bear Necessities. Administrator Walter Givens maintains that the store will still be fully operational.</p>
<p>“The Bear Necessities is selling many of the items that we sold last year,” Givens said.</p>
<p>Other clubs and organizations, however, will have to alter their fundraising routines.</p>
<p>“You have to be within those guidelines,” DECA advisor Jeff Darr said.  “But school clubs are allowed a couple of days each semester to still operate and sell items that are not within the federal guidelines. They have at least given us an opportunity to sell some of the things we’ve always sold, either through clubs or organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adjusting to the new regulations will be an ongoing process.</p>
<p>“It can have a huge impact on student groups that typically have made a lot of their money through the sale of food items at lunch,” Darr said. “It does force us to look at other non-food fundraising options that are out there.”</p>
<p>Darr is optimistic about the changes he may face during the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s good for us because we do have to eat healthier while we’re here,&#8221; Darr said. &#8220;We’re going to sell some tumblers for the first time ever; sports tumblers with KU or Wichita State or those type of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as pizza sales go, students should have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re still selling pizza. Just once we use our allotted number of days, we basically have to operate under the umbrella of the guidelines. I know Pizza Hut and Papa John&#8217;s have developed a pizza that meets the nutritional guidelines.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Uncle Joe’s Pizzeria recently opened across the street from Northwest High School, where Talliano’s Pizzeria was previously located.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like any other average teenagers, a friend and I were hungry after school, so we decided to go try this new place out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Walking into the pizzeria shortly after school, we saw that it was very, very slow&#8230; But it is still very new, so not many people have heard much about it. Being the only people in the pizzeria at this time, though, we got to talk to the owner a little bit about the restaurant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The owner asked if we were students from Northwest, and, of course, we told him yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">He asked what time our lunches start. “First lunch starts at 10:47 and second lunch starts at 12:14,” we told him. He said he thought it was pretty early, but was considering opening up the pizzeria around 10:30 instead of 11:00 so students could venture across the street for some pizza for lunch. He was always ready to open at that time anyway. Since the pizzeria is still fairly new, it would be a good start to getting a little more business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for the food?</p>
<p>There is a salad bar, pizza buffet, pasta, calzones, anything you’d expect to see at a pizza place. They’ll even ask you if you have any special requests for pizzas for the buffet! I personally think the pizza is great, but the customer service could use some work. To the girl that took my order, please try not to look so mad next time.</p>
