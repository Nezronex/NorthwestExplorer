										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest’s Grizzlies For Change will be hosting a first annual clothing drive called Recycle For Youth Sports Clothing Recycle Drive. The drive will begin Oct. 7 and last till the 25. Brian Latta, who is in charge of Grizzlies For Change, will run the drive.</p>
<p>Everything collected in the event will go Goodwill. For every pound of clothes collected, the school will receive 10 cents. If the school gets up to 1000 pounds, then we will enter a drawing for $1000.</p>
<p>“This is the first time the school has ever done it,” Latta said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grizzlies For Change is also in charge of other clothes drives around the year. The two clothing bins outside on the 13th St. side of the school are managed by the organization. They get picked up yearly by Goodwill as well.</p>
