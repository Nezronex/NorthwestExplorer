										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bright and early Monday morning, August 14, 2023, Northwest High school welcomed our freshmen. There were 367 freshmen students who were navigating the halls, learning about the school’s culture and schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first week of school is different for everyone- freshmen are transitioning and rushing around trying to figure out the hallway system and how to be a high school student. Freshman Casey Stuart said the beginning of the year was an adjustment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was cool, kind of a bit boring. Awkward, though, because no one wanted to talk in class,” Stuart said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ike Childs said Northwest was better than his previous school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was pretty good, a lot calmer. Not as many fights surprisingly,” Childs said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One big difference, the freshmen have noticed, between high school and middle school is block scheduling and time difference. Here at Northwest, class periods are 80 minutes long, which some students were finding hard to get used to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“..classes aren’t too hard. Just longer periods and that’s annoying,” Childs said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change from middle school is lunch organization, everyone going at the same time. A benefit that seemed popular is being able to hang out with different grades.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like being able to hang out with upperclassmen since there’s not many cool freshmen,” Childs said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">A pungent smell invades the nostrils of Abby Fickle as she frantically grabs the keepsakes from her car. A sense of urgency seems to drown out the chaos, she grabs the last of her things that she can get at this moment and takes off. Away from her precious car as it is engulfed in flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Abby Fickle, a junior at Northwest who loved her car, a Volkswagen Beetle nicknamed Spike, an astronomical amount. For Abby and her friend Tianna Piña it was a fairly normal lunch at the start of a new year. They had just gotten into Abby’s car and had attempted to turn on the air conditioning. It turned on but both of them noticed a sliver of smoke emerging from the controls. At this point in time they still drove it around this is where the first signs of trouble started appearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The smell started becoming something very very strong to the point where you could feel it inside your stomach and made you grossed out,” Tianna Piña, (11), said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">After a while things started picking up, according to Tianna and Abby. The smoke grew darker black and increased in quantity. The stench carried by it became even more gut-wrenching at this point in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The black smoke kind of reminded me of a house fire, but luckily we were just in a car, so we could get out safely,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the black smoke started sweeping through her car, Fickle drove back to school grounds. Thinking quickly, Fickle drove her car into the parking lot away from other vehicles, calling her dad for advice and help. They opened up the hood and in the process discovered the fire on the side of her car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“He told us to disconnect the cable from the battery just in case that would help, and as I rounded the corner of the car we saw the fire fuming,” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the fire raged on, the windows were the first to break due to the intense heat. After that,&nbsp; Fickle and Piña were escorted away from the vehicle and into the nurse’s office. There the realization of what had truly happened hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“What was going through my mind was&nbsp; something that was new to me, and I don’t know why I reacted this way, but I started laughing,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">While Piña felt hysteria, Fickle understandably felt pure sadness not only that, but also she had endured a borderline traumatic experience. At the nurse’s office both were found to be healthy, despite all circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“I kept getting reminded by dad whenever I was sad about it, that if I had done anything different we both could have died, or something worse could have happened” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">The car itself was totaled, a large portion of it completely destroyed by flames. Fickle only had liability insurance though, leaving her without a vehicle at this moment, but Fickle does have plans to bring back some life back into an old mustang her sister owned.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“It’s weird, a change, but we worked on it all day and now I drive that,” Fickle said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to Covid-19 people are required to wear mask in a public place. There are still people who refuse to wear a mask in the store. It’s a requirement but every once and a while you&#8217;ll see people without a mask. Do they have a point to not wear one? What should happen to them? Is there other things mask can do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a requirement to wear masks in public whether someone’s at a gas station, the store, or a restaurant. Mask may not make a person immune to Covid-19 but it helps lower the risk of them getting it. It helps keep people safe and healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people who don’t wear mask when they are supposed to I feel like there should be proper action taken. I feel if someone doesn’t wear a mask in a public place, anyone who works there should ask them calmly to wear a mask or leave. If they refuse to leave they should be denied service. Now if someone starts causing a huge scene the worker should just leave them alone to stop any possible physical confrontation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who don’t wear mask should really look at the unnecessary trouble they are causing. For the thirty minuets of wearing a mask in a store isn’t bad if its helping keep people safe from the pandemic. Wearing a mask is not only helping you but others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask can do more than help keep you safe from a pandemic. Mask can help keep your face warm in the winter. Little kids who have allergies don’t quite understand how important it is to sneeze in your arm or tissue. So wearing a mask can help block that sneeze. Wearing a mask can help in so many different ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask is important and if people refuse to there should be proper precautions taken.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With&nbsp; Christmas right around the corner Amazon has been really busy with people buying gifts. Amazon has list of popular gift ideas for different ages. These list have been really helpful for kids who don’t know what they want and for people who don’t know what to buy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be difficult to buy Christmas gifts for children who are newborns to 2 years old. Things that amazon has to offer for newborn children are books some that are normal and ones that talk, onesies, baby toys, and baby tooth brushes. For kids who are older there are bigger toys on the website. They offer kids appliances like washers, fridges, and ovens that young kids would sure enjoy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids who are 3-5 years old start to get into more character toys. Amazon offers many different character toys that young children would enjoy. They have Paw patrol, super heroes and baby yoda. They also offer LOL, Barbie, and baby shark. They also have non character things like play doh, coloring activities , and stuffed animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For children 6-8 amazon offers a little more advanced toys and activities. They offer more complex Lego city, Lego friends, Lego avengers, and Lego Minecraft sets. They also offer S.T.E.M sets, jewelry sets, and art sets. There is also a couple popular board games like mousetrap, clue, and chutes &amp; ladders on the site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids who are 9-11 are in the weird faze where they aren’t little kids but not teens yet. Amazon offers many different toys that would fit their ages and interests. They offer many things for artistic kids like spirograph, 3D coloring puzzles, blank comic books, how to draw books, water color painting, and rock painting sets.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Altgilbers is a freshman at Northwest high school who enjoys academics. He enjoys academics&nbsp; like history, drama, reading, and even studying things like military and politics. He has his thoughts on Trump, music, and movies like everyone else.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers listens country music and likes it over other music. He has a disliking for modern music. Altgilbers states modern music is artificial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Modern music just seems excessively artificial to me” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers likes to read, learn about history, do drama, study military on the weekends, and meatloaf. He enjoys drama because he enjoys putting on theater. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The class I am most interested in is drama because I very much enjoy putting on theatre,” Altigilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like everyone else, Altgilbers has his thoughts on politics and Trump himself. He thinks Trump isn’t good at what he does but has some good points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thoughts on Trump are that he&#8217;s really not good at anything he does, unless he&#8217;s creating chaos. He&#8217;s very good at that. Some more thoughts on Trump are that he was pretty competent as a businessman, but not as a president,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers is a fan of Star Trek and there is one movie he prefers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Star Trek VI is my favorite movie because it has my favorite things and tells a great story with them: sci-fi, diplomacy, and rogue generals.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covid-19 cases are on the rise once again. Things that people need to fulfill their basic needs are flying off the shelves. People are starting stock up in fear of another shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limits are slowly starting to be put into to the works. Limits are starting to be put on toilet paper and paper towels where you can only buy one of each. Things like beef, pork, and chicken are starting to have limits as well. Slowly soda is starting to get limits at Dillon&#8217;s and Sam&#8217;s.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toilet paper is flying off the shelves like it did earlier in the year. Stores like Walmart, Dillon&#8217;s, and Costco are stocked with plenty of toilet paper in variety of brands. Sam&#8217;s on the other hand are struggling to keep toilet paper on the shelves. Once toilet paper is put on the shelves it’s gone within minuets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canned food like beans, fruits, vegetables, and soup are almost impossible to find on a daily basis. Throughout the week it gets harder to find can food. It’s better to go get canned food on days a store stocks so you have a better selection before things start to disappear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not soda is getting harder to find during the pandemic. Popular brands like Pepsi, Coke, and Sprite are getting harder to find at stores like Costco and Sam&#8217;s. Stores like Walmart and Dillon&#8217;s are stocked on the popular brands but non popular brands like lemonade are almost impossible to get your hands on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of materials to fulfill basic needs are one of the many problems that Covid-19 has caused.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 has been different and not what everyone had planned. There is one thing right now that people are debating over and that is Trick or treating. Should kids go? Should kids stay home? What are some other options? Everyone has their own opinions on these questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to COVID-19 we have to take proper precautions to stay safe like social distancing, wearing mask, constantly using hand sanitizer, and staying inside. These things we have to do to stay safe is messing with Trick or Treating. It isn’t possible to Trick or treat and do what its necessary to stay safe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angie Rodriguez-Guzman, a freshman, has her opinions on why kids shouldn&#8217;t trick or treat this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I personally do not think kids should trick or treat this Halloween. Though candy is in packages it&#8217;s still unsafe because the outside of those packages is still being touched by the person giving out. Kids are going door to door breathing in air that isn&#8217;t safe,” Guzman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Altgilbers is another freshman at Northwest who has opinions on Trick or treating in 2020. He believes that it’s not safe and kids should stay indoors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do not think that kids should trick or treat this year. It&#8217;s definitely not safe, children are irresponsible and don&#8217;t wear masks willingly,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While trick or treating isn’t safe parents will still go to let their kids have some fun since 2020 has been a rough year. Guzman said that even though trick or treating isn’t safe there are a few things parents could do to make it a little safer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they do trick or treat, always wear a mask even under your own if you have a mask costume. Best to wear gloves, and before stepping into the house either leave the costume outside or spray disinfectant spray on it before stepping into your home for everyone&#8217;s safety. I also think spraying the candy wrappers with disinfectant before touching them is a good idea,” Guzman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safest thing to do on Halloween this year is to stay indoors. Guzman and Altgilbers both have a few alternate options to do instead of trick or treating. Guzman said you could trick or treat in the house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ Dressing up is still always an option but staying home is the safest. You can do a trick or treat in your own home, decorate it for spooky season, bring your family together, and trick or treat from room to room,” Guzman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Halloween will be different this year it will definitely be something for the books. Halloween will be celebrated differently but memories will be made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As for what parents could do to keep it safe, just keep the kiddos in and buy them some candy. Instead of going out, they could stay in and watch a movie,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[What makes a “good” teacher, or principal, or as a general statement someone who calls the shots is an open question.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes a “good” teacher, or principal, or as a general statement someone who calls the shots is an open question. Some would consider a good authorizer one who doesn’t give much work while others would tend to consider one a good authorizer if they had them on their feet 24/7 and always had work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hard work makes anybody a great candidate for any profession. When a teacher works hard to get you quality material that makes them a good teacher,” freshman Mia More said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More said she believes that the main thing that makes a good teacher is their attitude and their push for motivation.&nbsp; While some new teachers,&nbsp; may tend to struggle with this, most are able to take the time to get to know their students well enough to understand what kind of workload the students can handle. However, when a teacher takes that extra mile to make sure you understand the material, that makes them outstanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A teacher that is willing to adapt to modern-day, even if they have been there for 20 years, shows that they’re willing to make the change for the better well being of the students,” freshman Elayne Logan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logan said she believes she would rather have a teacher talk about what&#8217;s in now rather than a teacher who sticks to the &#8220;old fashion&#8221; way of teaching, which doesn&#8217;t really work nowadays. Logan said that because most teachers have a stuck mindset on how teaching can be, they close themselves off to improvement and that’s what stops them from being a good teacher because they’re not willing to improve how they teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most teachers don&#8217;t really care if you actually understand, some are just trying to make it to payday. The ones who choose to stick around for so long are proven to be a good teacher,”&nbsp; More said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to differentiate between the teachers who actually teach because they want their students to learn and the teachers who teach because they’re just there for the money, More said. According to More, when you find a teacher who is genuinely concerned if you are managing the workload given, that makes them a great teacher.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each and every person has their own views on what can be considered “good” in this world but it’s your job to be able to identify why the specific thing you’re leaning toward would be considered to be a “good” thing or position.<a href="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-7206" src="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="317" srcset="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg 475w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-122x80.jpg 122w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-120x80.jpg 120w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060.jpg 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></a></span></p>
