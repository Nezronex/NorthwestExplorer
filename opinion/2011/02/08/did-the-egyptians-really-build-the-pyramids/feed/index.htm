					<description><![CDATA[Mm. Sure. Somehow, it doesn&#039;t really seem more likely that aliens built it them then that, perhaps, the Egyptians were a little more ahead then we thought. They&#039;ve been building pyramids for 1000 years. I mean, think how far we have progressed in 1000 years...we went for the horse and buggy and log cabins to the incredible unbelievably powerful computer you are looking at in just about 200 years. Imagine what people from the 1000&#039;s would think of our technology. Who knows what a civilization with one ruler with that much time could accomplish. That&#039;s a lot of time to perfect building perfect squares. These structures you claim were Egyptians trying to replicate the aliens may well have been earlier, less successful attempts, like rough drafts. Why not?
      Maybe even some of the inconsistencies were pure chance. If you look hard enough for coincidences, you will find them. Humans love to look for patterns. A hand of all diamonds, all in order, is exactly as likely as any other hand you might get. I mean, as for &quot;the height of the pyramid is 481, which is almost exactly 1/1,000,000,000 of the distance from the earth to the sun (480.6 billion feet)&quot;, the only reason this number is so round-looking is because we use a base-ten number system. We haven&#039;t always...at some point we used base 12. How likely is it that these aliens used our counting system? Maybe the Egyptians discovered pi. That seems less far fetched then help from the stars. If they spent 20 years building, how long do you think they spent planning? Its not like they were any less intelligent then us. They are the same brilliant, inventive species that we are today.]]></description>
