When some people hear that word they think of it as the best time of their lives, while others think of it as their worst. Only being a sophomore, I can\u2019t really say for sure which way I\u2019ll think of high school after I graduate, but here\u2019s what I think so far.<\/p>\n<p>Sports. Homecomings. Pep rallies. Freedom. Those are only a few things that make high school worthwhile. There are sports to play and events to watch. Homecomings to dance with your crush. Pep rallies to show school spirit. And freedom to finally drive and leave for lunch.<\/p>\n<p>Credits. Colleges. And cliques. Now these are a few things that make some of us dread high school. You can\u2019t slack off in any classes, there\u2019s credits that must be earned in order to graduate. Colleges and scholarships put pressure on us to know what we want to pursue in life. And cliques sometimes makes us lose our closest friends.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which side you\u2019re on when it comes to the word, meaning, and realization of high school, you will always remember the experience. Whether the memories made throughout the four years are some we wish we could re-live. Like having a crown placed on your head for winning homecoming. Scoring the winning point in a game. Or rekindling a flame you shared with your crush, the memories will follow you for a lifetime. On the other hand you might have memories you wish could fade away. Like that one time you lost your best friend. Or when you when you had to retake a class because you failed, and you needed that one credit. Good or bad. Enjoyable or brutal. The four years spent in high school are never forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>For example, chemistry teacher Carl Hinote\u2019s high school experience was the best years of his life, while language arts teacher, Katie Adams\u2019 not so much. Adams remembers her high school years as nerdy. Adams focused on school a lot; she always wanted to maintain her 4.0 GPA.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most memorable thing from my high school years was a math grade. I was never great at math, I was always awful. I remember I use to write out paragraphs next to my answers to explain how I got them. And my math teacher gave me my first D, he said he didn\u2019t accept essays. It almost messed up my 4.0, luckily I got my grade my up with extra credit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although she had the grades she wanted throughout high school, which was a plus, the negative things she dealt with and had been through during high school, she wouldn\u2019t ever want to re-live.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have the best high school experience, so to that essence yes [I would re-do high school]. But there\u2019s no way you could pay me to go back through what I went through again. So overall, no.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, Hinote had some of the best years ever in high school. He thought of high school has a \u2018social time\u2019. In fact, his high school experience was so great, he had a hard time deciding what was the best memory he had, but when it came to the worst memory the answer was \u2018mandatory finals\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe best memory was prom. Senior prom. Our theme was named after a movie, \u2018Sea of Love\u2019, so there was like 100 of us that went to see the movie before prom, then we ate, and went to prom. So it was a really fun time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With a ton of good memories, Hinote does have one regret.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf I could re-do high school I would. I would get more involved. Like with drama, and sports. I wasn\u2019t ever involved until my senior year. \u201d<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, Hinote had the best time in high school, while Adams\u2019 had one of the worst times. Hinote has memories he can still think about and smile, Adams\u2019 has memories she has to force herself to think about when getting interviewed, and every question was answered with a frown. Hinote\u2019s experience was good and enjoyable. Adams\u2019 was bad, and maybe even brutal. Although these two teachers have different perspectives on high school, each teacher remembers the experience. Why? Because the four years spent in high school are never forgotten.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>High school.
