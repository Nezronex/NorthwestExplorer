But the teachers are not trying to annoy you, they are just trying to save the precious little money the school has.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe school\u2019s budget is no secret,\u201d principal Karen Pickert said, \u201cand so it\u2019s no secret that we have been cutting back on spending due to the decrease in funding. A decrease of approximately $3000 from last year alone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDue to the regulations of the Kansas State Department of Education, our commissions on vending machines has dropped drastically,\u201d Pickert explains \u201cWe had already experienced a decrease of around $20,000 over the last 10 years and with the new guidelines, it will probably continue to decline.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>These cuts don\u2019t only affect students; the food served at meetings, student events and faculty in-services has also been cut.<\/p>\n<p>Cutting back on paper is an easy way to save money for more important resources for the school. Since paper has gone up $6.44\/carton in the last five years, which makes it $26.19 a carton, paper usage seems to be an easy thing to monitor.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLast year, in the first week of March, 60,000 sheets were run through our small copiers, 12 cartons of paper,\u201d Pickert said.<\/p>\n<p>Teachers can help to fix this problem, and one of these ways is demonstrated by science teacher Carl Hinote. Hinote has come up with a notebook idea in which students can go online and print it themselves, pay for the printing cost from the school or make their own notebook with a three ring binder.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot only does this save money for the school, but it\u2019s an easier way for me to get them the information and help them stay organized,\u201d Hinote said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe also monitor the use of custodial supplies very carefully,\u201d Pickert said, \u201cbut one of the largest cutbacks has come from energy. The entire building was not air conditioned during the summer and was shut down for 3 days every week.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cPull out another sheet of paper to add to your notebook,\u201d math teacher Sarah Gegen says.
