Wichita Thunder hockey team has been playing in the CHL (Central Hockey League) since 1992, and has grown very popular in Wichita. Junior Keaton O\u2019Malia has a dream of playing professionally one day, and he has started by joining the Thunder\u2019s junior league.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">O\u2019Malia started playing hockey when he was 8 years old. He was inspired to play after his sister took him to his first \u00a0game, and has been hooked on the hockey life ever since.<\/p>\n<p>Before he started playing he was interested in other sports, but once he began competing, that all changed.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt\u2019s always been a dream of mine to play professionally,\u201d O\u2019Malia said, \u201cBut I\u2019ve been forced to look into other careers because you can\u2019t play your whole life. I&#8217;m undecided on what career I want, but I do know I want to play for Notre Dame. I\u2019ve always wanted to go and play there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wichita Thunder\u2019s junior league is a new team put together this year. The ages range from 16-21, and the average age for players is 19. O\u2019Malia and one other player are the youngest&#8211;both being 16&#8211;currently playing, and the only ones that are still in high school. Playing on the team gives you the opportunity to be scouted by a college and continue on with the dream of playing professionally.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI remember one of the guys who played [for Thunder] around 6-7 years ago: Travis Clayton. He has always been a role model to me when it comes to hockey. He\u2019s now a coach for a team in my league and my team played his team not too long ago. I thought that was pretty cool,\u201d O\u2019Malia said.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the past two years, O\u2019Malia has become more dedicated to hockey than ever. He practices or plays everyday attempting to accomplish his dream.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to work hard enough and maybe one day get a scholarship from it. It\u2019s that inner drive, I guess,\u201d O\u2019Malia said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Living in Wichita, if you&#8217;re at all familiar with hockey, Thunder is a team you have probably heard about.
