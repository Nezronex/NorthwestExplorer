The views of the mountains and the sea were just the most spectacular thing you would ever see.\u201d Grommesh said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is such a great opportunity to go outside the country, according to Tyler Grommesh, \u201cYou are always told that these places are out there and [that] they have harbored human civilization for a millennial,\u201d said Grommesh. He was astounded about seeing these places in person verses in the pages of a text book. Seeing these attractions and stepping onto new soil for the first time made everything feel surreal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the more interesting landmarks and places he has visited include<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Book of Kells in Ireland, the Welsh Castle, Tower Bridge and Buckingham Palace in London, Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was, inevitably, some flaws in the trip, \u201cI don\u2019t think I would go back to France simply because of how dangerous, dirty, and cramped it was,\u201d said Grommesh. He shared a story about how a girl was forced to pay for something that the vender forcefully put on her arm. They were even warned about people who would pickpocket. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on Tyler Grommesh\u2019s comments no matter the flaws it is crucial to visit different countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI can\u2019t honestly recommend going out of the country enough,\u201d said Grommesh. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t think you can afford it, you should try to visit other countries especially in Europe at some point in your life.\u201d&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The unique culture, interesting laws, difference in food and language, makes other countries much more fascinating than the United States to most people.
