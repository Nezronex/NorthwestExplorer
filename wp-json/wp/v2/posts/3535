The goal? Create a delicious, nutritious school lunch for the enjoyment of their peers. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had made enchiladas and our fruit and a vegetable side dish,\u201d O\u2019Conner said, \u201cThe fruit had kiwi, oranges, cinnamon, and granola mixed into it. Our vegetable dish was a bean cilantro. Mostly everyone liked it, but we didn\u2019t come in first place.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The students had to have some food purchased for them and provided with pre-cooked hamburger meat before their meal was prepared and presented before a group of judges. The winners of this competition would receive a paid trip to Washington D.C. and have their food  incorporated into the school food. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur next competition will be with the whole entire state,\u201d O\u2019Conner said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be going to a hotel, and we designed our own restaurant that\u2019s called the Royal Soul Food and it has a bakery in it.\u201d<br \/>\nAccording to culinary instructor Alison Draut, O\u2019Conner, Wooley, sophomore Cheyanne Sanders, and junior Haleigh Lovings will be participating in two competitions: management and edible garnish. For the management competition, students will be presenting a restaurant before a panel of judges which can range from business owners to chefs from universities. The edible garnish competition will have students sculpting things like dinosaurs, or flowers, from fruit.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m preparing by taking it on as if I was really opening one [a restaurant],\u201d Wooley said, \u201cso I called all the places and I\u2019m so, ready. I can\u2019t even explain how ready I am for this.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The two will participate March 3 and 4 with students from all over the state of Kansas. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all about winning,\u201d O\u2019Conner said, \u201cthat was a small competition this one this one is going to be a whole lot bigger and we want to show our school.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Two Northwest students joined several other teams from Wichita Public schools to compete in a cooking competition on Jan. 27 at South High.
