Anderson was relieved at this, since she did not want to perform someone else\u2019s monologue.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt was easier because it was my own work; if it was someone else\u2019s, I\u2019d be kind of worried, because I wouldn\u2019t know how the author would want it portrayed,\u201d said Anderson.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most tedious part of the process for Anderson was the brainstorming &#8212; coming up with a solid storyline to environ the monologue around.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt was easy when I got an idea and ran with it, but thinking of one was kind of difficult,\u201d said Anderson.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The idea of pouring her own thoughts out into a piece and presenting it to room full of peers was extremely nerve racking.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anderson\u2019s monologue was written about a mother in a therapy session explaining how she got in a car wreck, and how she had blamed herself for the death of her husband and twin girls.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This was not a personal experience for Anderson, but she had based it slightly on her friend who had been in a car accident.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt was difficult, because it\u2019s hard getting up there and doing your own stuff,\u201d said Anderson.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drama isn\u2019t just about acting.
