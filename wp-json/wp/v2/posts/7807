Some would consider a good authorizer one who doesn\u2019t give much work while others would tend to consider one a good authorizer if they had them on their feet 24\/7 and always had work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHard work makes anybody a great candidate for any profession. When a teacher works hard to get you quality material that makes them a good teacher,\u201d freshman Mia More said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More said she believes that the main thing that makes a good teacher is their attitude and their push for motivation.&nbsp; While some new teachers,&nbsp; may tend to struggle with this, most are able to take the time to get to know their students well enough to understand what kind of workload the students can handle. However, when a teacher takes that extra mile to make sure you understand the material, that makes them outstanding.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA teacher that is willing to adapt to modern-day, even if they have been there for 20 years, shows that they\u2019re willing to make the change for the better well being of the students,\u201d freshman Elayne Logan said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logan said she believes she would rather have a teacher talk about what&#8217;s in now rather than a teacher who sticks to the &#8220;old fashion&#8221; way of teaching, which doesn&#8217;t really work nowadays. Logan said that because most teachers have a stuck mindset on how teaching can be, they close themselves off to improvement and that\u2019s what stops them from being a good teacher because they\u2019re not willing to improve how they teach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMost teachers don&#8217;t really care if you actually understand, some are just trying to make it to payday. The ones who choose to stick around for so long are proven to be a good teacher,\u201d&nbsp; More said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to differentiate between the teachers who actually teach because they want their students to learn and the teachers who teach because they\u2019re just there for the money, More said. According to More, when you find a teacher who is genuinely concerned if you are managing the workload given, that makes them a great teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each and every person has their own views on what can be considered \u201cgood\u201d in this world but it\u2019s your job to be able to identify why the specific thing you\u2019re leaning toward would be considered to be a \u201cgood\u201d thing or position.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC_0060.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-7206\" src=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg 475w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC_0060-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC_0060-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC_0060-122x80.jpg 122w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC_0060-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC_0060-120x80.jpg 120w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/DSC_0060.jpg 1501w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What makes a \u201cgood\u201d teacher, or principal, or as a general statement someone who calls the shots is an open question.
