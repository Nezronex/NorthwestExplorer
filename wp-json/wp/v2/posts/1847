Breaking Dawn Part Two, after seeing all the movies and reading all the books I think that Breaking dawn Part Two was a great way to end the series.<br \/>\nIt had a lot \u00a0of action and also a happy ending, although my only two problems with the movie was the CGI, it felt like I was watching graphics from 2001, I mean I know that Twilight makes tons of money why not have spent it on some better CGI?<br \/>\nThe other was the bad acting it was very over dramatic but only towards the beginning after they brought it more characters it got better, other than that it was a good movie.<br \/>\nNow if you&#8217;re not a fan of Twilight I wouldn&#8217;t recommend seeing it. But if you are, you will love it.<br \/>\nAnother nice touch at the end of the movie had credits from everyone in all of the movies from the Twilight saga.<br \/>\nI would rate the movie a 3 out of 5. \u00a0But I would honestly would wait to see it on DVD instead of in the movies because it was a good movie but not worth seeing in the theater.<\/p>\n<p>photo MCT Campus<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The last of the franchise.
