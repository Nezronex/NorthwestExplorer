He plans on being married by the time he\u2019s 25, a father at 30, and a grandfather at 50. Even though his father is a Wildcat fan, Ashton supports the Jayhawks. He performs academically at the same level as, or even above, his fellow 7th grade classmates.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Ashton also has autism, which prevents him from being able to communicate effectively. He can answer questions that require one word answers but can\u2019t respond to open ended questions. Ashton has never been able to hold a \u201ctypical\u201d conversation with anyone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It pains his father and Site Technology Specialist Brian Latta to see his son unable to verbally express himself because of his social impairment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cHe wants to communicate, he wants to tell us about his day, he wants to have friends,\u201d Brian said. \u201cHe wants to do all of those things, but he knows his disability is going to hold him back from those and he gets anxious and upset.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Brian sometimes finds it difficult to understand why Ashton feels anxious or upset since he can only give one word explanations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cMy wife has the patience of Job,\u201d Brian said. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing so she never really gets frustrated with him. It\u2019s really hard for me because I want to sit there and talk to him and have a conversation like we\u2019re having.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">While he still can\u2019t have a conversation in this way, Ashton has recently discovered an alternative that has changed his family\u2019s lives: Brian is now able to effectively communicate with his son for the first time in 13 years via email.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cHe\u2019s in a computer class so that\u2019s how he\u2019s able to email me, my father, his grandfather, and my wife, his mom,\u201d Brian said. \u201cHe\u2019s able to email us every day about his day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Shari Luebbe, structured learning teacher at Maize South Middle, has set higher expectations for Ashton than previous teachers and has been patient while he reaches them. Brian credits her strategy for many opportunities that are opening up for his son, including making friends for the first time.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cAny students that maybe aren\u2019t following the general curriculum but they need a voice, that\u2019s our job,\u201d Luebbe said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job to figure out what\u2019s needed and what we can do. You always look at a student\u2019s strengths and then you go from there: how can we channel that?\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Autism is characterized by impaired social interaction, which has prevented Ashton from forming many relationships in the past. This became evident as early as when Ashton was eight months old.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t crawl, he wouldn\u2019t reach, he didn\u2019t want to be held, he didn\u2019t really want to be touched,\u201d Brian said. \u201cIf you put a toy out in front of him he wouldn\u2019t reach out and grab it. He just showed no signs of connecting with either his mother or I.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">With help from the structured learning staff at Maize South, though, Ashton has been able to form more relationships than ever before.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cHe keeps everything lively and happy,\u201d para Kristen Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty social. He loves being around the other students. He loves to gives pats on the back, high fives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Brian hopes that every child with disabilities discovers their own way to thrive.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cI see it here at school, I see it everywhere where kids are really smart,\u201d Brian said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of finding a way of getting it out of them. And that\u2019s what great teachers do. They find a way to open them up and allow them to learn and be a part of the school. That\u2019s what Maize South has done so well for Ashton.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Luebbe says the credit doesn\u2019t belong to her&#8211;it takes a village.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cI can\u2019t do my job without all of my support staff,\u201d Luebbe said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do our job without great parents and students, as well as other peers and administration. It\u2019s a team effort.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Madeliene Rainbolt, a structured learning para who has worked for two school years with Ashton, agrees on the importance of a supportive community. She also emphasizes the importance of changing perspectives on children with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cThey\u2019re children first,\u201d Rainbolt said. \u201cThat\u2019s a really important thing to remember if that\u2019s not a population that you work with all the time. A lot of people who don\u2019t spend a lot of time with our students look at them and see the disability. It\u2019s really important to remember that they\u2019re human beings with dignity and feelings, strengths and weaknesses.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Brian recognizes his son\u2019s weaknesses, but he\u2019s thrilled that Ashton is learning to manage them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cHe still has communication issues, that\u2019s never going to go away. He still has anxiety issues, that\u2019s never going to go away. But at least now he\u2019s able to function in a school setting, and be like a normal kid with friends.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ashton Latta wants to make you laugh, even if that means playing the same joke 20 (or 30, or 40) times.
