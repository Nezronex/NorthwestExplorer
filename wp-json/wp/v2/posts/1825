But whether we realize it or not, we make an impact on them and ultimately make their work worthwhile. Everyone has a story to tell, and it is with that, that the anonymity of the lunch ladies sparked an interest for a story.<\/p>\n<p>She was born and raised in Jamaica, and then moved to Nottingham, England, to become a nurse. She has a laugh that is incredibly contagious, and a smile that shows the world her magnanimity. She has great compassion for her mother, who she says was a very strong woman. She believes that other than having her daughter, the most valued aspect of her life is just being alive. To us students, we know her as the lunch lady, but to her loved ones and everyone else, she is known as Carmen Baker.<br \/>\nAs a child, Baker\u2019s dream was to be a teacher like her mother, however she later changed her mind. Thirty years ago Baker came to America from England for better opportunities within her practicing field as a nurse.<br \/>\n\u201cThe nursing school here was in a sense different, because I had to produce my papers, and they said I\u2019d have to have it before I could do my LPN work and my nursing school was all done in England so I just work in St. Francis as an aid and so forth,\u201d Baker said, \u201cthen during that time I did several things. Nursing aid, CSN, home aid, pack meat; you have to do everything to survive. Then after that I came into the school system where I worked as a custodian.\u201d<br \/>\nBaker was a custodian for about six years when she fell on some ice and hurt herself, as a result of this she later went into the food service, thus ending up here at the old school of blue and gold. Baker says that doing her job makes her happy, and she believes it has many rewards to it.<br \/>\n\u201cI have the opportunity to serve various kids. Lots and lots of different kids. Some of them are just being bad, but I love them. The various kids there make it interesting, and even if you come across to one or two, you can help them to just be nice.\u201d Baker said.<br \/>\nOut of everything, if Baker could say one thing to every student who crosses paths with her, it would be to simply try their best to go far in life.<br \/>\n\u201cI tell them that they should persevere with their dreams to accomplish what they want; don\u2019t waste time.\u201d Said Baker, \u201cListen to their teacher, listen to their older folks, and listen to their dreams. Because a lot of these kids have no goal.\u201d<br \/>\nBaker lives out her own dreams, as she hopes that students try to do the same. However, she realizes that this may not always be the easiest thing to do, but she believes that this should not stop anyone from obtaining the impossible.<br \/>\n\u201cSometimes you plan for something and it might not come true here and then,\u201d Baker said. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t deter you from your future. Because sometimes, maybe because of the money, you can\u2019t get what you want, but if you\u2019re determined to do something it\u2019s better than nothing. Just hold your head up high and you\u2019ll accomplish your dream.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Students typically don\u2019t pay too much attention to our lunch ladies, after all, students are simply there to get their lunch.
