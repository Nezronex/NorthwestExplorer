You\u2019re only at school for seven hours, you can do it, promise.<\/li>\n<li>Taking lots of notes helps out in the end. Even with how annoying and boring it is taking lots of notes, it makes it easier to study, especially for finals.<\/li>\n<li>Remember, you aren&#8217;t alone. There are hundreds of teens experiencing what you are and you\u2019re surrounded by peers, upperclassmen, and staff that will help you if you ask!<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t be afraid to make new friends. High school is your \u201cfresh start\u201d. Go in with a good attitude, turn things in, get involved, and make memories with the people around you.<\/li>\n<li>Get involved. It helps the year go by faster and helps your high school years seem like more than just books and work.<\/li>\n<li>Voice any questions you have to other students or staff. Questions are there to be answered, and that\u2019s the point of school: to gain the information you need.<\/li>\n<li>Do your homework. It might seem like busy work, but it actually helps you retain the information.<\/li>\n<li>Procrastinating. As great as it sounds to sit back and watch Netflix rather than doing your homework, it\u2019s better to get things done early rather than waiting till the last minute to get it done.<\/li>\n<li>Get to class. Or rather, don\u2019t stand in the middle of the halls and take up space to talk to your friends. If you have to do that move to the side so people can get around you.<\/li>\n<li>Watch the attitude, this is something that ties in with respect. You might think you\u2019re top-dog, but you\u2019re not, and it\u2019s important to watch what you say. You might think you\u2019re all-that-and-a-bag-of-chips, but, once again, you\u2019re not. It really pays off to take a breather and respect the person you\u2019re talking to.<\/li>\n<li>Remember you\u2019re all in the same boat, everyone has been. Popularity isn\u2019t important, so don\u2019t worry about how you look in the eyes of others. Be confident and get things done.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t sweat it. If you\u2019re having a rough time or getting stressed, take a breather. Go off and play a game for 30 minutes, rant to your best friend, read a book&#8211; do something that helps you relax and then reevaluate the problem.<br \/>\nThat essay\u2019s important, but so is your mental and physical health!<\/li>\n<li>Get involved! Attend assemblies, show your pride, be happy to be a grizzly. It makes the school a far better place.<\/li>\n<li>Read the paper, keep up online, and follow our Twitter. It\u2019s quality stuff, and one of the most important things in the school, obviously.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Respect authority, rules, peers, and staff.
