Really, it was spearheaded by Mr.Givens, being as he is the senior class principal, he wanted to have it somewhere nicer.\u201d said junior class sponsor Brian Latta.<\/p>\n<p>The Scottish Rite building is cheaper to rent than The Cotillion. The Cotillion was $2,000 to rent with an additional 3 dollars per person, totaling at $3,600. The Scottish Rite Center is about $2,700 after additional charges. Including the DJ and decorations, prom is estimated to cost around $7,000. This years decorations are being made by the Northwest Stagecraft; they will receive payment for their contributions.<br \/>\n\u201cI think we spent a little more money last year on the overall prom decorations so we are actually starting off with less money than we have in the past. \u201c junior class sponsor Angela Mcdonald said<\/p>\n<p>Prom is being held on an earlier date due to the only other option at the Rite center being  Easter weekend. Other venues such as the Abode and the Indian Center were discussed, but considering their venue sizes and other amenities,  the Scottish Rite Center was the best option.<br \/>\nDespite the change of venue, other traditions will remain. Following the lead of previous years, the junior class makes up the committee that will plan the event. The theme for this years prom will be Belle Noire, meaning \u201cblack elegance\u201d.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a long tradition of prom being held at the Cotillion, there are expected changes to come in 2015.
