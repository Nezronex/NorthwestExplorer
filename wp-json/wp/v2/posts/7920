Well I have compiled a list of 10 animes in no particular order that I think beginners should start off their anime journey with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attack On Titan<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genre: Action, dark fantasy, post-apocalyptic&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Status: Ongoing&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where to Watch: Netflix and Hulu (I&#8217;ve watched almost all of these animes with a really good ad free anime website called 4anime.to but don\u2019t let the government know that-)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reasoning: This is a legendary anime. It has gorgeous art and animation, you get connected with characters straight away and the plot is captivating. Definitely a recommendation for someone wanting a good series to get sucked into.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My Hero Academia<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genre: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adventure, fantasy, superhero<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Status: Ongoing<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where to watch: Hulu and Amazon Prime<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reasoning: Chances are that you\u2019ve heard of this anime even without watching it. This anime has gotten so famous that it\u2019s known worldwide and has millions of dedicated fans. And it has such a big following for a reason. The storytelling is beautiful, again, gorgeous art and animation, and the show is packed full of charming characters. In fact, my favorite anime character of all time comes from this very show. An all around astounding show.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Haikyuu!!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genre: Comedy, coming-of-age, Sports (volleyball)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Status: Ongoing (only anime)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where to Watch: Hulu and Netflix<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reasoning: Much like My Hero Academia, this show also has a loyal audience.

The way these two men express their love for each other when they&#8217;re out on the ice is more beautiful than what I can say in words. Just please go watch it, you won&#8217;t regret it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Demon Slayer<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Genre: Adventure fiction, dark fantasy<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Status: Ongoing (there\u2019s a movie coming out for this as well!!)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where to Watch: Hulu<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reasoning: This is another one of those animes that has you hooked by episode one and makes just wanna keep watch.
