Become their favorite child by acting better than your siblings; if you\u2019re an only child, be nicer than the dog.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3) Pretend to spend copious amounts of time on homework: Tears are a good tool to make your parents feel bad for you. Ask for lots of help, which they can\u2019t give because high school was forever ago for them. Remember to promise you\u2019ll get the teacher\u2019s help.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4) Remind them that you\u2019re trying your hardest: After all if you\u2019re failing the teacher must be mean.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1) Apologize: Profusely. Promise to try harder and\/or ask the teacher for more help.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2) Say you\u2019ll make up all late work: It\u2019s advisable to actually follow through with this one, so you can avoid future situations like this.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3) Take it like a man: If you\u2019re grounded, you\u2019re grounded, just go willingly to make the punishment less brutal. Crocodile tears also help lessen the blows (if you\u2019re a good actor).<\/p>\n<p>4) Try harder in school: For real, the stress of bad grades is more painful than the stress of daily school work and effort in class.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before: 1) Prevent your parents from finding out if possible: Try to intercept any messages and progress reports.
