Everyone wants to hold the title \u201c90\u2019s kid\u201d weather they actually remember all of the greatness of the 90\u2019s or not. It has become a touchy subject because some kids know some of the landmarks of the era, but the sincere 90\u2019s kids know its not about the material greatness that came, it\u2019s about the culture.<br \/>\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the boy bands and the toys that broke your ankles played a large part of the 90\u2019s. The world was just starting to realize its potential. Video games and tv shows were at their turning points and the toys were not high tech but they got the job done. Cartoons ruled the world and had so much character you never knew what was coming.<br \/>\nIn the end though, that\u2019s not what made the 90\u2019s great. The reason true 90\u2019s kids brag about it so much is because we revel in the culture lost to other generations. The 90\u2019s were about waking up on Saturday morning to watch cartoons and being outside with your friends gushing about the new Backstreet Boys song. The 90\u2019s were about the new designs of a teen magazines and the craze over the pop scene. It was about Pokemon and the Game Boy Color.<br \/>\nIt was a simpler time where the world was growing, and we got to grow with it.<br \/>\nWhen we were kids, we played outside and hung out with our friends and lived life worry, and technology, free. The computer scene wasn\u2019t big and the video games we did have didn\u2019t rule our lives. We were around for the start of technology, and we learned it as it came out.<br \/>\nBut as 10-year-olds, we did not have the brand new iphone. Instead, we still threw a fit when no one rewound the VHS after they watched the movie and carried around our portable cd players.<br \/>\nIt was a simpler time, and our childhood was filled with goodnatured fun.<br \/>\nAs technology found self knowledge and grew, we learned how to use it but not rely on it.<br \/>\nThe 90\u2019s was a great time to be a kid, and it is sad that the culture is lost to generations even in our high school.<br \/>\nThe last of the 90\u2019s kids are graduating, or will be shortly, and with us the culture and spunk we all carry with us, ingrained into our brains since our childhood, also leaves the scene.<br \/>\nThe 90\u2019s raised us, and the culture seeps out our pores in everything we do. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being a 90\u2019s kid is one of the most fought over claims in today\u2019s teens.
