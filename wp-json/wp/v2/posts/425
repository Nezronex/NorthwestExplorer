However, Schoenberger had suspicions of being pregnant her junior year. After being continuously asked to take a test by the baby\u2019s father, Schoenberger finally did. Seeing the pink plus sign, Schoenberger wasn\u2019t too shocked; she already figured she was, the only thing she was worried about was telling her parents.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI never told my parents; they asked me if I was [pregnant] because I was getting sick a lot,\u201d Schoenberger said.<\/p>\n<p>Her parents reacted better than she thought. Although her mom was \u201crude\u201d about the situation, both parents were there for their 17-year-old daughter. Schoenberger\u2019s parents pushed her to keep her options open. Her mother really wanted Schoenberger to consider adoption, but her mind was already made up.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI knew I was going to keep her. I just couldn\u2019t give up something that was inside of me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Schoenberger\u2019s junior year was changing drastically. Not only was Schoenberger pregnant, but she was also the new girl at Northwest, having transferred from Bishop Carroll. Schoenberger felt like all eyes were on her every single day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt showed me who my real friends were. Some people became more distant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At times Schoenberger felt alone. Her relationship with her parents had somewhat changed, some of her friends acted like they never knew her, and she felt the baby\u2019s father wasn\u2019t even there for her in the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe was selfish about the situation. He only thought about him and his future,\u201d She said.<\/p>\n<p>February 22 was when Schoenberger\u2019s life changed forever. After having cramps the night before, she went to her scheduled doctor\u2019s appointment. An hour later <em>it was time<\/em>. Schoenberger\u2019s mother and two close friends were with her at the hospital. Finally, at 11:53 p.m. Schoenberger was holding her baby daughter, Melia.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy first impression was \u2018wow, this is crazy. My daughter is really pretty.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For the next month, Schoenberger was out of school to take care of her newborn baby. The first night home from the hospital was hard to adapt to.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe cried a lot, and she woke up so many times.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The following weeks were filled with dirty diapers, baby vomit, bottles, and little sleep. Returning to school with a baby was something she never imagined herself doing. The first day of senior year for Schoenberger was Melia\u2019s first day at the Northwest Child Development Center.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI never took her to daycare my junior year. I didn\u2019t want her to get sick by other babies. I was very careful and cautious when she was first born,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been close to one year since Schoenberger\u2019s belly grew and Melia was born. Now, Schoenberger\u2019s relationship with her parents has improved, and Melia\u2019s dad is in the picture. Schoenberger says school is still easy for her, and she has no problem juggling her job at Xenon\u2019s and raising her daughter.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNights are easier now; she sleeps the whole night. But during the day Melia is more high maintenance since she\u2019s moving now. When she\u2019s sick or teething it\u2019s really hard. She gets super cranky,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Going through and adapting to all the changes, one thing has managed to stay the same for Schoenberger.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy goals haven\u2019t changed. I want to go to college and make money,\u201d Schoenberger said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Senior Sara Schoenberger had been a fan of the MTV reality TV shows \u201c16 and Pregnant\u201d and \u201cTeen Mom.\u201d Watching the shows every time a new episode aired, Schoenberger never thought she would become one of those girls.
