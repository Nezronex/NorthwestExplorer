Included among these are the bowling and scholar\u2019s bowl teams, both of which compete during the spring season, and both of which are setting records.<\/p>\n<p>The boy\u2019s [varsity] bowling team set three records ending in a win 29-52 Tuesday, Feb. 2 against Heights. The boys varsity bowling team\u2019s highest one- and two- game series also set state records for the highest series ever bowled. The Junior varsity bowling team also placed in the top three in all of their tournaments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat sets us apart from other schools is that we have exceptional \u00a0coaches,\u201d Latta said jokingly.<\/p>\n<p>Latta is not the just the coach for bowling but for JV softball and scholar\u2019s bowl as well. He took all of his teams to state.Scholar&#8217;s bowl hosted the regional tournament Feb. 4 and took first place.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe tournaments, usually the first 15-30 minutes consists of gorging on whatever food they have provided. Usually it&#8217;s pizza,\u201d senior scholar\u2019s bowl member Chris Kliewer said.<\/p>\n<p>Scholar\u2019s bowl consists of 5 person teams that go against another school. They are asked 16 questions total, the first of which is \u00a0foreign language questions like French, German, and Spanish. Other subjects like language arts, social studies, science, mathematics, fine arts, and current events are included in the 16 questions.The first person who buzzes in and gets the question right receives ten points. The team with the most points at the end of that round wins.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cScholar\u2019s bowl is all about humor, keeping the kids up and involved,\u201d Latta said. \u201cDuring the school day, a lot of these kids that are in scholar&#8217;s bowl may not say two words, but when they get to the scholar&#8217;s bowl practice, they\u2019re having the time of their lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The commitment and time to coach two teams during the same season and to make them successful shows how committed these coaches are. To have a coach that brings students together and make them strive for excellence make it more fun to play a sport.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c The dedication and the want, they want to be there they want to do it,\u201d junior bowler Sam Kuns said.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4993\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4993\" style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Scholars-Bowl.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4993\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4993\" src=\"http:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Scholars-Bowl-475x267.jpg\" alt=\"The scholars bowl after winning Regionals. \" width=\"475\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Scholars-Bowl-475x267.jpg 475w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Scholars-Bowl-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Scholars-Bowl-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Scholars-Bowl.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4993\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The scholars bowl after winning Regionals.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4994\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4994\" style=\"width: 356px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Bowlers.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4994\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4994\" src=\"http:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Bowlers-356x475.jpg\" alt=\"The Northwest bowlers after winning a tournament.\" width=\"356\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Bowlers-356x475.jpg 356w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Bowlers-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Bowlers-675x900.jpg 675w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Bowlers-300x400.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Bowlers.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4994\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Northwest bowlers after winning a tournament.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For Northwest , the 2015-16 school year has been a series of victories, from the football winning streak \u00a0to the bowling and scholars bowl teams.
