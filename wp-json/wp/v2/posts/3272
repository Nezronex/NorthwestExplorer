These informational events will help make your choice a little bit clearer, so when you go to these events at the end rate it from 1-10 on how well you liked it.<br \/>\nStart researching funding for school: This is the best year to start looking into how much school is going to cost. Another thing that you should be aware of, are scholarships, grants, and loans.<br \/>\nMentoring: Now lets say you already know what you want to do, start looking for mentors that are apart of the field, you plan on pursuing one day. This will help you begin to understand the process of the job.<br \/>\nPSAT practice test: The PSAT is an optional test for sophomores, but highly recommended, to prepare for Junior year, where scholarship money is included to the highest scores.<\/p>\n<p>Junior: Well Juniors you are literally more than halfway to that cap and gown, YAY. But you\u2019re not quite there yet, so don\u2019t start slacking because you still have more than a year left to continue to prove to your dream school that you are worthy of attending. <\/p>\n<p>Fall:<br \/>\nTake the PSAT: This test qualifies you for the  National Merit scholarships and programs, and is highly recommended to take for scholarship opportunities.<br \/>\nAttend college fairs: This step will bring clarity to the questions you may have for a college or many colleges.<br \/>\nExplore Careers: Lets face it in about a year in a half you will literally be living on your own and finally starting your life. So it\u2019s best for you to be looking, if you don\u2019t already know, for the career that you plan on having for a very long time. My advice to you, is to try to find something that you like, or else you will be very miserable.<br \/>\nTake the ACT\/SAT(East Coast Schools Only): Take the ACT in the fall\/winter so that if you don\u2019t do so well you can always have time to study, to take it again in the spring.<br \/>\nSpring<br \/>\n Research ways to pay for college: Now we all know that college is extremely expensive and that scholarships can only get you so far, so look up ways to save money so that in the end you can say, \u201cyes I\u2019m paying my way through school\u201d.<br \/>\nStart looking into scholarships: This is where the money is people, so look into it, see what you qualify for, and pay attention to deadlines.<br \/>\nContact Colleges: Contact the colleges that you are interested in, to get more information on them, for example, what you need to even get into the college.<br \/>\nDON\u2019T GIVE UP: This is the year that grades are most important because, these are probably going to be the last grades that the college will see, so \u201cGo big or Go home\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Senior:  Well you made it, you literally are less than 6 months away from saying goodbye to high school forever.<\/p>\n<p>Summer<br \/>\nNarrow down colleges: Narrow down your top 3 colleges.<br \/>\nStart college visits: Well lets say you have narrowed down your colleges to your top 3, this is the step, that should put everything into perspective.<br \/>\nEnter FAFSA: This will help big time, this  helps find out how much financial support you will receive.<\/p>\n<p>Fall<br \/>\nCollege Applications: Get these filled out, and pay attention to deadlines. This is how you will have any chance of getting in.<br \/>\nScholarships: Look, look, look, these things give money. Pay attention to deadlines.<br \/>\nRequest transcripts and letters of recommendation: With letters of recommendation, this will help the colleges help understand what kind of student you are. The transcripts will be the grades you worked so hard to get.<br \/>\nMeet with counselor: Your counselor will help make sure you have all the credits you need to graduate.<br \/>\nRegister for Federal Aid Pin: This will also help with financial need.<\/p>\n<p>Spring<br \/>\nCollege Acceptance: Keep you eyes open for those acceptance letters.<br \/>\nMake your final decision: This is it, this is the time to make that decision that will change your life forever.
