Many of the companies who run the media have merged, giving the aforementioned countries a monopoly on what you learn by way of the TV, news stations, and online news articles.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tests prove that every time you read, watch, or see something, it is stored in the back of your brain. Read too much by the same source and you start becoming influenced. \u00a0In 2009, a study was conducted that teenagers spend an average of 31 hours a week on the internet.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Dr. Anthony Curtis, five companies hold 95 percent of the revenue in media: Walt Disney, Viacom, News Corporation, Time Warner and CBS. Chances are, with the 31 hours teenagers tend to spend on the Internet, teenagers begin to be influenced by at least one of the media moguls.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With most of the internet being ran by one of five companies, it is easy to only hear one side of the story. Read the same kind of articles from the same source over and over and you take the power out of your own hands by giving up the power of your own opinion.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure you listen to multiple sources before coming up with your own opinion. Listen to both sides. (Read both the pros and cons, both sides of the argument, watch both Fox News and CNN.) Be sure of your personal beliefs and values. Do not let a persuasive sounding article sway you to do anything. It is easier to close a pop-up ad then it is to simply hit the red X on doubts niggling at you in your own head. Don\u2019t put yourself in danger by simply accepting everything you are told.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"The Dangers of Social Networks\" href=\"http:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/opinion\/2014\/01\/14\/the-dangers-of-social-networks\/\">\u00a0Allison Moore&#8217;s story.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You will be in danger if you keep reading this article.
