We used the word \u2018peace rally\u2019 because protest just has a lot of negative connotations,\u201d said junior Hailey Colborn. \u201cIt was a rally for unity, positivity and peace.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alongside many others, Colborn doesn&#8217;t understand why the rally received backlash.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[People] should understand an event before [they] automatically take a stance,\u201d said Colborn. \u201cBecause if they would&#8217;ve listened, the only thing we were trying to do was promote equality.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colborn even claims that while some parents honked at them for support, others flipped them off while being visibly annoyed. Junior Emerson Ross was also a participate of the peace rally that supported the idea of spreading equality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was basically something to show people that everyone should learn to love each other and not hate,\u201d said Ross. \u201cAlthough we are minors and we can&#8217;t vote, we are still affected by discrimination and we are showing [others] that we do have a voice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He too does not understand why the rally, that was suppose to promote peace, received negative comments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt didn&#8217;t make sense, because if you don&#8217;t like a protest against discrimination that&#8217;s basically saying that you are for discrimination and that&#8217;s terrible,\u201d said Ross. \u201cWhy would you want to belittle someone over the way that they are, over the way they\u2019re born?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Keaton Fish states that he is \u2018not against a group of students standing up for what they believe in\u2019 but does believe that the peace rally was slightly inappropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDriving into the school and seeing all those people, just knowing that it was more about the election than what they would like to say it was,\u201d said Fish. \u201cIt kinda felt like they were trying to call us out and say that we were racist or homophobic.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He believes that the protest date was \u2018conveniently\u2019 right after the election and that the protestors should have postponed the rally until the drama revolving around President elect Donald Trump died down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf they would&#8217;ve waited I, myself, would&#8217;ve gladly stood out there with them and supported [their cause],\u201d said Fish. \u201cBut because of what has been going on at the same time, it felt more like it was an attack politically than it was a standup for peace.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fish turned 18 during the spring and took the opportunity to vote for Donald Trump. And although Colborn was an organizer of the peace rally she claims to not have a stance against either presidential candidates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI&#8217;m not taking like a pro-trump or anti-trump stance on anything,\u201d said Colborn. \u201cQuite frankly, I don&#8217;t even know what party I&#8217;m in because I\u2019m only 16 years old.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the peace rally did receive some objection, so have a few Trump supporters. \u201c[Donald Trump] has made very racist comments, he has made very sexist comments,\u201d admitted Fish. \u201cBut because I don&#8217;t agree with what [Hillary Clinton] was saying, people automatically think that the words that he said came out of my mouth.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students who are Trump supporters still believe that this peace rally was more of a political protest than what the participants would like to admit. While on the other hand, protesters believe that they were just showing everyone to spread love not hate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regarding the question if Ross would participate in future rallies he says,<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe fight&#8217;s not over in ending discrimination. And until that fight is over, I want to make sure that I&#8217;m a part of that fight to spread love.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In response to the incline of discriminatory acts that have occurred after the announcement of the new president of the United states, a few Northwest students decided to hold a protest, or peace rally as participants like to identify , before school on the 14th of November. \u201cWe don&#8217;t really like the term \u2018protest\u2019.
