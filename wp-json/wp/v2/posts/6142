Speaking two languages, Senior Kanako Daicho has the opportunity to explore and live in the United States. She studies American culture, adding the knowledge she gained from past visits to Hawaii.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daicho decided to become a foreign exchange student in order to feel more independent. In Japan she always had to rely on her family, but by living abroad she is independent and connects with other people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Alyssa Blumanhourst is the \u201csister\u201d she lives with while she\u2019s in America, and she also has three other siblings that come and visit Kanako and Alyssa once a month. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI bond with Alyssa more because we are the same age and we have three classes together: Concert Choir, US History and Algebra 2. She helps me a lot when I\u2019m struggling,\u201d Daicho said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the classes to the culture, Daicho has noticed many differences in America and and Japan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn Japan there are a lot of mountains. Also, it&#8217;s different from America, because Japanese walk a lot since everything is very close. In America they need cars to get to a lot of places.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At school in Japan, the teachers had their own room. Students stayed in one class while the teachers rotated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daicho said she finds American students to be more outgoing than their Japanese counterparts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAmericans are more friendly and talkative to strangers and us Japanese are humble, quiet and modest,\u201d Daicho said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Japan her favorite activity is being in an art club . The members of her art club visit places such as the art museum, where they draw and paint. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe prepare for our school festival once a year. People come and examine the art and we invite guests to let them experience our art,\u201d Daicho said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At her home school\u2019s festival, kids get together and celebrate their culture. In America she loved that she was involved with \u201cHairspray\u201d, she was even backstage painting the set. Daicho says her experiences in the United States have had a definite impact on her character.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI have changed from living in America by becoming stronger and independent. I have to pay attention to my host family so I don\u2019t trouble them,\u201d Daicho said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the future she sees herself coming back to America to visit her friends and her host family.
