They pointed and laughed but we knew deep down that it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts,\u201d junior Brian Taylor said after his group\u2019s not so attractive car won farthest distance.<\/p>\n<p>Physics students built cars out of various materials that are powered by a single rubber band and then graph the displacement, velocity and acceleration.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun and frustrating,\u201d physics teacher Lynda Snyder said about her classes\u2019 recent rubber band car experiment. \u201cStudents have to work together and think \u2018outside the box\u2019 to create a working, beautiful car.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The class was divided into groups of four and each group brought in materials to build and decorate a car. But for some students their favorite part of the lab was racing their car against their classmates. Cars were pitted against each other in attempt to win fastest car, farthest distance and a variety of other categories, including best design.<\/p>\n<p>Junior Thalia Fenton\u2019s group built the car using two sizes of Quick Trip lids, a water bottle, wooden sticks, straws and a rubber band.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe hole punched the bottle to poke the axels through then hot glued the wheels,\u201d Fenton said.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of this experiment was to learn about acceleration. After the competitions were over it was time to get to work. Students had to record and graph the acceleration of their car.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur car accelerated pretty fast and then it would back up a little before stopping,\u201d junior Nicole Dohrman said. \u201cOur car was simple compared to others, but it was lighter in weight so it was faster.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[Students learn] a little about designing, force, friction, stability, a lot about patience and perseverance,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cThey can see how the car moves and relate that to their calculations and graphs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some other cars included a Sunny Delight bottle with a cape made by junior Olivia Resch, junior Morganne Wiltse and their group and junior Cayla West\u2019s group a car made only with things found in the classroom.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sophomore Brian Taylor high fives his teammates quickly after zooming across the finish line.
