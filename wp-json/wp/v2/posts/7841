I personally like old original movies better but I do think that this movie is better for younger kids. I remember being younger and scared of this movie a little bit so I do think this one is more animated and joyful compared to the old one which is better for younger kids whereas the original Grinch movie is more fun for everyone.&nbsp; <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bad moms Christmas&nbsp; Site: Netflix&nbsp; Release date: 2017 Rating I would give: 4.5 star Reason: This movie was funny but also included scenes such as a mom and daughter reconnecting and making their relationship better.
