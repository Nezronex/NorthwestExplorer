The performing season kicked off with Irving Berlin\u2019s western comedy \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun\u201d Friday, Oct. 4 and 5 at 7 p.m., and Sunday, Oct. 6 at 2 p.m.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gun-totin\u2019, sharp-shootin\u2019 Annie Oakley falls in love with the star of Buffalo Bill\u2019s Wild West Show, Frank Butler, upon his arrival in town. Frank prefers a girl who is \u201cas soft and as pink as a nursery,\u201d however, much to Annie\u2019s dismay. When Annie proves to be a better marksman than Frank, she lessens her chances of them being happy together even further. In the end, the two sharpshooters hold a rematch and Annie allows Frank to win the contest, but the competition ends up being a draw. Frank falls in love with Annie and the two sharpshooters get married.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Northwest presentation of \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun\u201d was, simply put, delightful. The charismatic dining car waiters before the show left the audience anticipating more country style charm. They weren\u2019t disappointed- the chemistry between cast members, the adept musical orchestra personnel and the overwhelming talent of the performers created the most entrancing atmosphere. Director Richard Lundin chose cast members for the show flawlessly and the students executed their roles just as well. As Frank Butler and Company said, there\u2019s no business like show business- and certainly none like Northwest show business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A chorus of cheerful greetings echoed throughout the Northwest Auditorium as dining car waiters with buttery popcorn, charming country accents, and bright smiles ushered in the Northwest Theatre Department\u2019s opening performance.
