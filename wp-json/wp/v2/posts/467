He\u2019s here all day everyday. His job is to keep everyone safe, and with ten years experience he successfully does that. It\u2019s security guard Brian Martin, some of you may know him by his nickname, Boe. Martin isn\u2019t your typical intimidating security guard, walking in the halls you can see he has a big fan base, and just likes to have fun while working.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI like how I can joke around, everything doesn\u2019t have to be tense all the time. I don\u2019t want kids to look at me and think \u2018oh he\u2019s a security guard we better stay away from him\u2019 because I like to have fun, Martin said. Kids can come up to me and we can joke around from time to time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When Martin isn\u2019t giving new drivers parking decals, checking who\u2019s in Cave, filling out reports on lost items, or supporting Market Day by eating three bowls of ice cream drinking two cherry limeades and tasting some tacos. Martin is where we see him the most, walking around the commons and hallways making sure every student is getting to class.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome days are boring, you\u2019re just wondering \u2018am I gonna\u2019 get a call\u2019? \u201cBut then that\u2019s like saying we want something bad to happen, and we don\u2019t. Sometimes the job just gets boring if there\u2019s nothing going on. But we also have our busy days too.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Watching Martin during passing period and at lunch, we can all see that a majority of us are stopping just to conversate with him, and get a few laughs in before we leave to our next class.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI hope they (students) think I\u2019m a good person. I\u2019m easy to get along with. I hope they see that they can come and talk to me about their problems and we can get the problem solved. Most of them know they can talk to me,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut I hope they see me as a good guy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Other than having to carry around all his equipment, which includes his badge, handcuffs, maze, walkie-talkie, and gloves, Martin doesn\u2019t dislike anything about his job. In fact he feels right at home here.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe administration is pretty cool, and the students are cool too. So it\u2019s good here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And although retirement is further down the road for this beloved security guard, he knows exactly what he miss will most.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just miss the kids. I\u2019ll miss helping them,\u201d Martin said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>He\u2019s a new face here at Northwest. He\u2019s here all day everyday.
