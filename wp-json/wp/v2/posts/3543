Don\u2019t get me wrong, not having class all day is awesome, but I sit at home always thinking of what exactly I\u2019m going to do with my life.<\/p>\n<p>Many of us have already decided on what we\u2019re doing after high school, college acceptance letters have arrived in your mailbox and the only thing you have to decide is what school you\u2019re going to. <\/p>\n<p>For the rest of us, we still don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to go to college, but we just can\u2019t afford it, we want to work, or go into the military. Maybe some of us had plans, but they just didn\u2019t turn out the way we wanted.<\/p>\n<p>So, now what? Graduation is a day closer as the days go by. We\u2019ve already presented our senior speeches, and the next big thing is probably prom.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m so stressed out, and I know many of you are too. I constantly ask myself, \u201cWhat am I going to do after the summer is over?\u201d My mom repeatedly asks how excited I am to finally graduate, but honestly I am dreading it. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to graduate, it\u2019s just, how am I going to become the person I have always wanted to be? How am I going to reach the top? Many of us are scared of failing, and I am probably the most scared.<\/p>\n<p>I remember many people telling me that high school was going to fly by, and to never skip school because it was bad, and that it was going to be the best years of your life. Many of us can relate, and to be honest, those people were right. It was dumb to skip math (I found that out myself by spending my summer in summer school), and it was definitely not very smart to stress over things like boys and drama than missing out on football games and homecomings. <\/p>\n<p>I do regret many things, like skipping out on the pep assemblies and not being involved in school more than I wanted to, but the end is coming soon, and there&#8217;s just no time to sit and think about all the things we could&#8217;ve done. <\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s live it up. Spend your last days like a true senior, smile, enjoy the last few walks through these halls, show your teachers a little more appreciation. Just a few more months until that diploma. <\/p>\n<p>Overall, you can&#8217;t deny that these last 4 years weren&#8217;t worth it. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s ok to be scared for the future, just be bold. It\u2019s ok to freak out, just stay on track. Don\u2019t just dream, but make it all a reality. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The year of 2015 has started, and reality is coming soon for the senior class of 2015.
