It\u2019s just not professional. So learning those proper social norms, I think, is important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Phones aren\u2019t her only concern.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSomebody talked to me about PDA and why they were getting picked on about holding somebody\u2019s hands or hugging,\u201d Steffes-Sundquist said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been in school. I\u2019ve held hands. I got called out in the halls&#8211;by my mom, who was the teacher in my class&#8211;and was told there\u2019s a time and a place, and it wasn\u2019t appropriate. That\u2019s just what this is.

I work really hard to make connections with students and help them understand that everyone\u2019s dealing with something. I try to help students work with whatever is stressing them at the time and help them realize that everybody\u2019s got something they\u2019re dealing with. They\u2019re not alone. We all just have to work together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She hopes for students to enjoy their high school years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHigh school is what you make it.
