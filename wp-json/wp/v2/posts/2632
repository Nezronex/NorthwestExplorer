Many families deal with the symptoms and many times the tragedies from cancer. Sophomore Samantha Assmann\u2019s mother, Sandy Assmann, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in March of 2013. Although the doctors in Wichita said there was no way she would make it through surgery to remove the cancer, there is a hospital in Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, which specializes in cancer and felt like it is safe enough to do the surgery.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u201cWhen my parents first told me that she had cancer and her life expectancy all I could do was cry,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe it, I still don\u2019t want to believe it. I never really accepted it. When I first found out I shut down.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">In March Sandy\u2019s life expectancy was two years, which really affected the Assmann family. Not knowing how long they have left with her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u201cI have learned to appreciate everyday with her more,\u201d Assmann said. \u201cNot knowing how much longer I would have with her made me appreciate everything she does for me and my family. I\u2019m even more thankful for her now than I ever was.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sandy\u2019s surgery to get the cancer removed was planned for Dec. 12 2013, but before they began the surgery the doctor noticed her liver was not looking very good. Therefore before they could proceed with the surgery the doctors have to replace a stent, which will allow fluids to drain internally.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt [is] nerve racking, exciting, scary and almost every other emotion,\u201d Assmann said. \u201cI\u2019m scared to death I\u2019m not going to see her again. I don\u2019t want to lose her. I can\u2019t lose her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Jan. 9 Sandy Assmann returned to Texas for her surgery. After surgery the doctor told them that she was cancer free.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u201cWhen the doctor said the words \u2018cancer free\u2019 in a sentence &#8230; all I could do was smile,\u201d Assmann said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Sandy will be able to return to her family back home Jan. 25th.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0\u201cI finally got my Christmas gift,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cI no longer have to worry about how long I will have left with her.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nine and a half months ago the surgery was not an option, but now it is.
