The average teen makes just above minimum wage for the first job. However, Senior Cj Rincones and David Duncan are changing the game with their way to make money as a teenager.<\/p>\n<p>Cj Rincones has always had a passion for shoes. During his freshman year, he decided to turn his passion into a business.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI personally have always loved shoes. so, when I started getting more shoes, I would do trades in order to get a different pair that I wanted that pretty much lead me to sell\/buying\/trading. Also, some of my friends were doing it and we\u2019re making money at a young age from it and I wanted to be part of that,\u201d Rincones said.<\/p>\n<p>David Duncan, a senior on the Northwest basketball team, also started selling shoes at a young age.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI started when I was 14. I had too many shoes that didn&#8217;t fit me, so I decided to sell them and buy some that did. Then I realized that I could potentially make money by buying and selling shoes, so I did,\u201d Duncan said.<\/p>\n<p>Rincones and Duncan have worked very hard to make this small idea into a successful business. They say that part of what makes them so successful is the fact that they enjoy what they do.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI enjoy being able to provide a pair of shoes to someone who wants them. I sell used and new shoes, and I try and charge under market, so my customer knows they&#8217;re getting the best deal. I also enjoy being able to have more expensive\/designer shoes that not a lot of people have. I also enjoy making money,\u201d Duncan said.<\/p>\n<p>Like any business, there are challenges that come with their job. Whether it\u2019s other competitors or even just try to sell an expensive pair of shoes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most challenging thing about it is getting shoes for retail. There is a lot of people who do what I do and when a limited shoe is about to release, everybody is trying to buy it. People use bots to get limited shoes when they release, I don&#8217;t but I am definitely going to in the future,\u201d Duncan said.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not Rincones and Duncan decide to continue with business in the future as a career, one thing is for sure: they will have much more business experience than if they were working at Dillon\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe best part is wearing the personal sneakers that I&#8217;ve wanted for a long time. Plus, the hustle of it is good for my future career,\u201d said Rincones.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most teenagers when they look for a job normally go find work at a grocery store or some sort of fast-food joint.
