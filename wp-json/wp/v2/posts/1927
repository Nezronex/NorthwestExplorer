Just like the carpets are swept and the tables are washed, the halls and classrooms are now being painted for maintenance reasons.<br \/>\n\u201cThe district puts all the schools on a rotation, and with that rotation they can only get to us once every so often,\u201d Principle Karen Pickert said, \u201cso it\u2019s going to take about three months to do, and with all the schools they\u2019re going to have to cover, there\u2019s a lot of painting that they couldn\u2019t wait until the summer to do.\u201d<br \/>\nWith all the painting being done, many are asking about the orange doors. However, for certain reasons, they cannot be painted.<br \/>\n\u201cWe talked to them about painting the doors blue, but the reason why we can\u2019t do that is because if they were to paint them and the door got scratched, the reddish-orange will show through,\u201d Pickert said.<br \/>\nSo far, there have not been any complaints about the paint. However, school officials say that in the event of a student complaining, they will do everything in their power to assist them.<br \/>\n\u201cMost people have adapted to it pretty well. If there is somebody who had problems with it, we would certainly make accommodations for that class or student if it was something that was bothering them. But we really haven\u2019t had any complaints,\u201d Pickert said.<br \/>\nSome students, such as junior Grace Buckingham, do not see the point in repainting the school.<br \/>\n\u201cThere\u2019s no difference between how it looked before and how it looks now,\u201d Buckingham said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably bad for us to breathe in the fumes, and the colors don\u2019t make sense since our colors are blue and gold, not blue and orange.\u201d<br \/>\nPainting the rooms means that the teachers have to take everything off of their walls. Although this is a hassle to many, Pickert feels it will ultimately worth it.<br \/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pain to take everything down, but if we don\u2019t paint them now, it could be 10 or 12 years until they paint them again,\u201d Pickert said, \u201cThat\u2019s why we are having to take advantage of it the best that we can.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You may have noticed the fresh blue stripe adorning the halls, along with the lovely fumes of paint filling the air.
