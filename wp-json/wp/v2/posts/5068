And it challenged my expectations."},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every so often, a person comes into the public eye who is so unusual that we can\u2019t help but stare. Sometimes, it\u2019s for purposefully brazen statements, designed to draw attention (Lady Gaga comes to mind), and sometimes the spectacle is simply a way of life we cannot understand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seemed to me that the reason for Donald Trump\u2019s continuing momentum in the presidential race was some combination of the two: his provocative proposals stand out amidst the (somewhat) carefully considered plans for gradual change that seem to constitute many campaign platforms, and his loudmouthed, flashy, frequently rude nature makes him a source of entertainment in the political arena. People watch him because they are shocked by him, because they do not understand him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, when I joined the line of thousands waiting to hear him speak in person, I was not surprised to see protesters in the dozens, wielding signs that read \u201cStop the Hate\u201d and \u201cNo Racism, No Trump.\u201d One girl among a group of Bernie Sanders supporters tirelessly asked every person in line why they were there &#8212; any response indicating support for Trump yielded a rapid volley of questions, most of which began with \u201cWhy?\u201d I felt inclined to shout along with them, to call out the injustices I\u2019d observed from debate clips and Twitter screenshots, even as I attempted to maintain an objective view of the events before me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, I was stunned to see masses of people who genuinely support this man as a candidate for the highest office in the land. Poll numbers repeatedly show his popularity, and ten states have chosen him over the other Republican candidates, but no piece of evidence could have prepared me for the sight of such overwhelming support, and from such a wide demographic of people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019d pictured most Trump patrons as people very similar to him: people who speak their opinions loudly, without regard for what other people think; people who call to mind words such as \u201ctacky\u201d, \u201crude\u201d, and \u201cuneducated\u201d; people who are, for the most part, older and white. But I was wrong. And I was guilty of the same stereotyping that makes so many people seethe with anger at Trump\u2019s words. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There certainly wasn\u2019t a shortage of those people I\u2019d pictured &#8212; many sported t-shirts, hats, and buttons emblazoned with his grinning face and his directive to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d But what I hadn\u2019t foreseen was the quiet old man who proudly showed a security guard a picture of him and his wife in front of their little blue house, and said that that very picture was what had gotten him a letter back from the \u201cvery busy man\u201d he\u2019d sent it to. I hadn\u2019t imagined the young girl who eagerly tugged on her father\u2019s arm and told him \u201cWe\u2019re almost there! We\u2019re gonna see Mr. Trump!\u201d as the line inched closer to the door. The young couple dressed for church, the man holding a cardboard sign with \u201cVietnam Vets for Trump\u201d sharpied on it, the Hispanic family waving and cheering as he came onstage &#8212; none of them were part of the mental construct I\u2019d made of \u201cTrump supporters.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His words still grated on me, and quite apparently on the many others who\u2019d attended the rally with the ulterior motive of shouting their disapproval at crucial moments in his speech. I took it somewhat personally when he asserted that the press are \u201cthe most dishonest people in the world, I tell ya!\u201d, citing an incident when a station \u201cbeeped out\u201d the end of a sentence even though he\u2019d supposedly said nothing. And I was compelled to cringe and turn away when he boasted that his infamous wall on the U.S.-Mexico border would indeed be funded by the Mexican government, and that it would grow ten feet higher at every protest they\u2019d make, drawing cheers throughout the crowded exhibition hall. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the disbelief and even contempt I\u2019d felt for his supporters has disappeared, replaced with a feeling of distant understanding. I get why so many people flock to this man who makes his impressions with displays of wealth and power. I get why people cheer at his radical proposals, the ideas that make conservatives and liberals alike stare in disbelief. He\u2019s unashamed of speaking his mind, regardless of how people may receive his words, and people admire him for that. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I still think some of those people are blind to just how dangerous Trump is. I think his loud mouth and brash plans will put this nation in trouble if he gets elected, and his supporters don\u2019t see that. Or maybe they don\u2019t care. But they are free to support whoever they choose, and I see now that they\u2019re not completely unjustified in putting their faith in the reality star-turned-politician. It\u2019s not a smart move in my books, but it\u2019s a move they have the right to make.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every so often, a person comes into the public eye who is so unusual that we can\u2019t help but stare.
