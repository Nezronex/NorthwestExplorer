It is kind of spooky but it is still appropriate for most ages.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Halloween Town<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Site: DisneyPlus<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Release date: 1998<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating:&nbsp; 5\/5&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reason: Halloween town is a classic halloween movie that can be watched by all ages. There are four halloween town movies and they all correlate with each other. The halloweentown series is a good series to binge watch on during a cool fall day.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coraline<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Site: Amazon prime video<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Release date: 2009&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 3\/5<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reason: Although Coraline is a good movie with the editing and detail put into every scene, it still scares me so much to this day at 17 years old. I do think Coraline has a very interesting plot and would be an amazing movie to watch if I was not as terrified but until I become less scared I will keep the rating at a 3.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Nightmare before Christmas<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Site: DisneyPlus<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Release date: 1993<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: 4\/5<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reason: Tim Burton movies are always classic movies to watch during halloween. The only reason I would give this movie a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the fact that it kind of has to do with Christmas a little bit. But if you are wanting to watch a more halloween movie by Tim Burton I would highly recommend watching Frankenweenie.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Addams Family Site:DVD Release date: 1991 Rating: 5\/5&nbsp; Reason: The Addams family is a classic movie that I enjoy watching at any point in the year but especially enjoy around Halloween.
