An inflatable bouncy house, snow cone machine, student performances and more greeted families as they entered the football field.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Families picked up student schedules at the entrance. They could then visit with the student\u2019s teachers, who set up booths along the track. Children were invited to take pictures in the photo booth or play games, also located alongside the track, while adults chatted with teachers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Principal Gil Alvarez said he worked with the family engagement team in hopes of improving attendance at the event.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cUltimately we\u2019re just trying to figure out how we can engage our families better,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a family atmosphere and a fun atmosphere than it is feeling like you\u2019re in a job or having to go on a time schedule.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Administrator Stacey Steffes-Sundquist believes that the move outside has successfully created this atmosphere, along with added student participation. Band, choir, JROTC, cheer, and dance showcased their talents on the field throughout the evening.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis is just a more positive start to the year,\u201d Steffes-Sundquist said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the students to get involved. It\u2019s not just the athletic crowd here, seeing these groups perform that always do.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teachers have made major adjustments from the usual Open House system, where teachers adhered to scheduled times to visit with parents. Dennis Cox, history instructor, is taking advantage of the time constraints being removed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ve always liked to have it in the classroom just to have that closeness,\u201d Cox said. \u201cBut they\u2019re only in there for seven minutes. Out here I\u2019ve been able to talk to parents longer than just the seven minutes which has been good.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History instructor Paul Kitchen sees the advantages and disadvantages of this system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI do like the interaction,\u201d Kitchen said. \u201cIt does make it difficult because you can get caught up in a conversation for a long time and not get to talk to somebody else.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only teachers are adjusting to the shift, but students as well. Senior Carlos Galindo is pleased with the switch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more entertaining and engaging,\u201d Galindo said. \u201c[The booths] are lit.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event will continue to be hosted outside next year. Alvarez is excited about the addition to Northwest tradition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHopefully every year it gets bigger and bigger,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited about how it turned out.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Northwest\u2019s annual Open House was hosted outside for the first time in school history on Tuesday, Aug. 25.
