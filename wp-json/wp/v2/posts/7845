The question is: Is it safe to travel? This year has been a harsh one, especially with the world-wide pandemic going around. Now with the holidays steadily approaching families are faced with the tough decision that is traveling.<\/p>\n<p>Following what the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) says if you do plan to travel, do it wisely. Consider your community. If there are cases spiking it is best not to travel. Another thing to take into consideration would be where you are traveling to. See if there are coronavirus cases spiking there. This is because airports, bus stations, train stations, public transports, and many other public places are prone to be exposed to the virus. Either it is on the surface or in the air. If you do still plan to travel these are the best things to take into consideration: Wear a mask in public settings, avoid close contact with anyone, wash your hands regularly, avoid touching your face, and finally stand 6 feet apart from people. Overall, the CDC says that the best option is to stay home. It is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of the virus.<\/p>\n<p>What does this mean for Kansas? This recent week Kansas has seen a massive spike of coronavirus cases. Amounting to an average of 2,439 new cases per day. What do the people at Northwest think?<\/p>\n<p>Crystal Kerr, science, said her family has decided not to visit this Thanksgiving.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey are better able to distance, but cases in the community are very high right now. We have been about as careful with safety precautions as we can, but I don\u2019t want to accidentally transmit something to others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kerr said that she believes that even if that does mean she can&#8217;t see her family, she would rather them remain safe and healthy.<\/p>\n<p>What do the students at Northwest think? Matthew Altgilbers freshman, said it&#8217;s not a clear cut decision.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt all depends on the destination. If you have been exposed to people within the two weeks of travel, do not travel.\u201d He went on to say that if you do end up traveling to take all the precautions into consideration in order to be able to be in a safe environment.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, this year has been a tough one but if people are safe there can be brighter holidays ahead.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is sad, but I feel like it is the right decision,\u201d Kerr said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Traveling for the Holidays?
