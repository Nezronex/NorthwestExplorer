If you\u2019re in sports, extracurriculars, have a job, or just need to keep up the social aspects of your life, that\u2019d leave you with eight hours to spend on those activities, before you\u2019d be required to cut into your sleep. <\/p>\n<p>For Alyssa Hershey, time can appear crunched at times, and on some days, it\u2019s a matter of choosing.  <\/p>\n<p>Hershey is involved in several things, both in and out of school. Being involved in several shows at Music Theater for Young People (MTYP), Music Theater Wichita (MTW) and Wichita Children\u2019s Theater &#038; dance Center (WTC &#038; DC) on top of school, higher level classes, church, band and even dance classes has lead to her having a jam-packed schedule.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt just kinda depends on what\u2019s going on,\u201d Hershey said, \u201cLike how much is going on at that point. Right now, I\u2019m handling it pretty well. A couple weeks ago, though, I was at a breaking point. AP classes, and end of the nine weeks, and being in two shows&#8211; it can just&#8211; it can get really tough.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The current D and F list policies doesn\u2019t affect Hershey due to her lack of participation in school sports, however her grades and extracurriculars such as: band, symphony, two dance classes, church Wednesday and Sunday, plus three advanced courses, can often lead her to having to make hard decisions and sacrificing things to find that balance. A few weeks back she had several shows and events packed into her short week, and found herself on the edge constantly. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t really sleeping that much, there was a few days in there where I didn\u2019t sleep at all. It was really healthy,\u201d Hershey said, \u201cThere were two nights where I pulled two all nighters in a row and I was just always doing something. Right after school I\u2019d be in rehearsals until late and then I\u2019d go straight home and do homework and just eat on the way. Then I\u2019d be up all night doing homework and the next day I\u2019d be doing it all over again. There was a couple times where I almost had a meltdown.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although Hershey doesn\u2019t have to worry about not being able to perform if her grades dip down into the lower levels, not all students are as lucky. Business teacher Jeff Darr believes that it\u2019s all a matter of finding a balance, which can be hard with all the things offered at Northwest, and even more so after they added an extra hour a couple years ago. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a point that we need to, as administrators and teachers, I think we need to at least look at the number of classes that we changed two years ago. we went from seven periods to eight periods in terms of classes that students could potentially have projects, homeworks, tests, and things of that nature.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Principle Alverez believes the D and F list is a good change for Northwest and thinks it should be seen as a positive thing. He wants it to be something to keep students, and teachers aware and seeking help if they need it. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think the D and f list was meant to be more of an awareness, not a punishment. The list came about because our athletic teams wanted to have a code of conduct that was tied into the d and f list that tied into the students grades. You had to have several ds and fs before you had your first warning week and after that week if it didn\u2019t come up then there were consequences rather it be no playing time or what not. I think everybody thought that you could only have one D or F but that\u2019s not the case, the case is we\u2019re trying to get students into torturing, in to see their teacher&#8211; We\u2019re trying to make it student friendly and not just a complete punishment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Junior Taylor Webber counters. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cBasically it comes down to you can not have a social life, good grades, play a sport, have a job, and get sleep. It\u2019s impossible. How am I supposed to do my homework if I only get two hours of sleep? \u201c<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are 24 hours in the day, at least seven required to spend at school, and, according to scientists, nine hours of sleep are required for teenage brains.
