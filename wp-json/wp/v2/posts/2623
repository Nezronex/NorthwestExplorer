In pursuing her dream in music theatre, she got pregnant and decided it was time to stop performing.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Never wanting to give up on her passion for music, she chose to start teaching.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She enjoys teaching because teaching to her is like \u201cparts of a team to make a goal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During her time at Arizona, she stumbled upon a man who she would later call her husband.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Needless to say, they fell in love, got married, and had kids. At this point Brown realized she should probably settle down and stop performing.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Brown was relentless to quit music theatre all together and made a decision to begin teaching.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Brown substituted at Wichita State University in 2000 for a while, and then moved on to a more official teaching job at Wilbur Middle School. Brown taught at Wilbur for 6 years and enjoyed every minute of it.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI\u2019ve always loved seeing people grow and change,\u201d Brown said.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After working at Wilbur for quite some time, Brown was offered a job as the choir teacher for Northwest High School; she accepted.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No matter what life threw at her, she could never drift from her musical habits.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So here she is now, her tenth year teaching for USD 259, inspiring her kids everyday and being inspired herself.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThere\u2019s this amazing thing where people think they can\u2019t do it, then you work with them and they do it,\u201d Brown said.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Brown loves teaching at Northwest and is always looking for ways to make each choir just a little bit better.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWe can do stuff at a professional level,\u201d Brown said.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even though teaching wasn\u2019t her original plan, Brown doesn\u2019t regret her decision.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSeeing that kid who never thought they could do it, do it.
