As a result, the Kansas Board of Education has had to find alternative ways to get funds to keep the school doors open. The school board is discussing cutting bus routes to trim from their current $27 million in transportation spending, but would result in making school more challenging for the students who rely on the bus for transportation.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Principal Gil Alvarez has already been made aware of the other potential cuts they are examining. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere are programs that are [being considered to be] cut for all students whether it be JROTC, AVID, fine arts, performing arts and athletics,\u201d Alvarez said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The faculty at Northwest has already planned the budget for next year and they have had to make a backup plan, just in case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf we have to, we have made a 10 percent cut to our building funds,\u201d Alvarez said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some other cuts being considered are school nurses, counselors, learning coaches, and assessment leaders. Counselor Betsy Terriere is feeling the pressure from these potential cuts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt not only hurts the people without jobs, but it also hurts the students because they won\u2019t have as much to be involved in,\u201d Terriere said. \u201cI\u2019m taking it a day at a time, I\u2019m trying hard not to think about it.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Lump Sum<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many teachers in Kansas face a decision that may affect their pay through the summer.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Kansas legislature fails to produce a budget the state Supreme Court considers constitutional by June 30, schools will face the threat of a statewide shutdown. In case this occurs, the school board and teacher&#8217;s union encouraged employees to take their salaries in a lump sum, instead of checks throughout the summer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of 64 Northwest faculty surveyed on March 31, 82.8 percent chose to take the lump sum option, compared to only 15.6 percent who took it last year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey\u2019re recommending people to take [the lump sum] because people are worried that \u00a0if the state doesn\u2019t go ahead and authorize the budget, that there will be no budget,\u201d speech teacher Peter Crevoiserat said. \u201cSo we will be furloughed and you won\u2019t have any money.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech specialist Brian Latta is discouraged by the thought of taking a lump sum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s kind of disheartening talking about shutting down schools,\u201d Latta said. \u201cYou\u2019d get your money from what they already owe you, but if they shut down schools [students] wouldn\u2019t be going to school and I wouldn\u2019t be going to work. That\u2019s obviously a problem.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nonetheless, Crevoiserat will stick to his usual pay schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cNo, I don\u2019t plan to take it,\u201d Crevoiserat said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the rumors that it would be \u2018prudent to do so.\u2019\u201d \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kansas is not new the media spotlight regarding issues on education spending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTen years ago was all about creation versus evolution and intelligent design,\u201d Crevoiserat said. \u201cThey had to put stickers on science books saying \u2018Evolution is just a theory,\u2019 and the national news was like \u2018Kansas, where your science book comes with a sticker.\u2019 So we\u2019ve always been known for having cuckoo stuff, it just comes with the territory.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crevoiserat recognizes that Gov. Sam Brownback is just like any other politician, meaning he\u2019s under a lot of scrutiny. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad guy,\u201d Crevoiserat said. \u201cI think he\u2019s made some decisions that have gotten him a lot of scorn.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latta thinks differently.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[We need a] new governor,\u201d Latta said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a new governor, though, some teachers are thinking of leaving the state and possibly the profession. Crevoiserat says he is staying.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m a Kansas person [and I] don\u2019t plan on leaving,\u201d Crevoiserat said. \u201cI heard of the people in Missouri putting up signs saying \u2018Come work for us\u2019. I don\u2019t even know anybody who would want to drive to Missouri.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Latta can understand why teachers might consider a new location. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don\u2019t think any honest educator is looking to leave Kansas for more pay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more about being treated fairly and feeling like they matter.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the rumors escalate the reality for a teacher continues to become scarier by the day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey are out of control,\u201d Latta said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to get worse before it gets better.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Legislature last year presented a block grant system that left schools in Kansas\u2019 poorer areas $54 million short.
