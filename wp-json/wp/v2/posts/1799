Well, there are lots of reasons why I like to dress up and why I think other people should dress up to school. Dressing up is a way to make myself comfortable. Most people would say heels and skirts etc., aren&#8217;t comfortable, but I&#8217;m not saying you have to wear those things.<br \/>\nYou can still dress up and be comfortable. Later in life we\u2019re going to have to grow up and go out into the world and dress for success, we&#8217;re going to have to wear suits, ties, heels, skirts, dresses why not start now, unless you work at McDonald&#8217;s and even then you still have to wear a nice pear of khakis.<br \/>\nFashion is going to stay with us for the rest of our lives, it&#8217;s never going to go. There&#8217;s always going to be something new, something better and even more trendy then before. I believe that we as teenagers express ourselves in the way we dress. when you meet someone new 1st impration is everything. a 1st inpration only takes about 30 sec and to change that 1st inpretion takes about 5 min. The way you dress should be a reflection of how you feel and what kind of person you are.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you guys know me, you know that I like dress-up every other day.
