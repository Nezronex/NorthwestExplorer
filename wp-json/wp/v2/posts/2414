A T-shirt design was also proposed and approved along with a possible trip to see The City of Bones, the movie based off the first book in the Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The book club also discussed last month\u2019s book, The Reluctant Assassin. Most of the club agreed with each other on their feelings about the book: they liked the characters and they liked the book- after it actually started moving.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After discussions about the book ended, the next topic was the books for the next three months. October\u2019s book is Austenland by Shannon Hale, a novel about a woman obsessed with Jane Austen, who goes to a place where people stay and pretend to participate in a world that imitates a Jane Austen novel. November\u2019s book will be the dystopian novel Divergent by Veronica Roth \u00a0about a society who divides you up based on your values. December\u2019s book will be The Help by Kathryn Stockett about a group of black maids working in white households in Mississippi during the 1960\u2019s. All three have been or will be made into movies.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Five officers ran to be picked for a form of office. Eventually, Emma Bennet was elected President, with four other members filling in the spots of vice president, \u00a0secretary, treasurer and historian.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The T-shirt design chosen will feature a stack of book and carry the slogan \u201cJust one more chapter\u2026Well maybe the rest of the book.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Future books that are up to be chosen for future months are The Maze Runner by James Dashner, Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand, Born of Illusion by Teri Brown, and A Tale Dark and Grimm by Adam Gidwitz. Other suggestions will be added when the book club holds its next meeting.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Austenland Trailer: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KbHr8YyjSlg\">\u00a0http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KbHr8YyjSlg<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Divergent Trailer:<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S6HHCxLZftQ\"> http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S6HHCxLZftQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Help Trailer:<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WbuKgzgeUIU\"> http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WbuKgzgeUIU<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Northwest book club recently had its second meeting to discuss the next three months and to hold elections for officers.
