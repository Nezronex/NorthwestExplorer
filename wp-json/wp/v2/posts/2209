This movie was very helpful\u00a0in\u00a0dealing with a Sharknado, if you ever have the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0of experiencing one. Without a doubt this was one of the best movies of 2013 and deserves an Oscar for both acting and animation.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what I would say if Syfy was paying me to do this.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sharknado wasn&#8217;t Syfy\u2019s finest movie. Along with a lot of puns and horrible CGI sharks, you&#8217;re pretty much wasting an evening. Ian Ziering, who was also in the TV show\u00a0Beverly Hills 90210, plays our hero Fin Shepard (the hero\u2019s name is Fin, and this is a movie about sharks- this is very fishy), the owner of a popular bar. With the help of his ex-wife and his bar employees, they speed around Los Angeles trying to save people from the dreaded flying sharks and also robbing convenience stores for their guns and chainsaws along the way. I don&#8217;t want to spoil the ending for you, but let\u2019s just say that thanks to this movie we now know how to stop a Sharknado. Thanks Syfy!<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The premiere of Sharknado gained around 2.1 million views and over 5,000 tweets per minute on Twitter. That\u2019s a lot of hype for a poorly made movie. Thanks to all the views, Syfy has announced that they will be making a sequel. With the help of Twitter, the title\u00a0\u00a0for the sequel is Sharknado 2: The Second One. They plan on releasing it next summer.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite how amazingly bad it is, you should watch it at least once. It\u2019s a cult classic. Sharknado has been released on DVD and is still currently being replayed on the Syfy channel. Who knows? Maybe this movie will come in handy someday when we experience our own Sharknado.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Side note: I actually love this movie and I\u2019m just poking fun at its mistakes. It\u2019s a really\u00a0great movie and I really think that you should\u00a0watch it.)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On July 11, 2013, the Syfy channel released its new original movie, Sharknado.
