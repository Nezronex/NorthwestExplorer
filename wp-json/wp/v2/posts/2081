When I was a cub, I wanted to earn the Arrow of Light and the Twentier Badge, the top two awards a Cub can earn. After five years, I accomplished these goals, along with earning the God and Country medal and a few trophies from the Pinewood Derby.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of fifth grade, I moved onto the troop level. After a few years in 709, I switched to Troop 450. I have been with 450 since, and have watched people come and go. When I entered troop life, I set a new goal for myself: to be the first Eagle scout in my family.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve the rank of Eagle, one has to earn 21 merit badges, with 12 of them being required for the rank. I started out strong in this category, earning badge after badge, as many as I possibly could. I slowed down after a couple of years, earning the rank of first class. After that, I became more of a mentor to the younger scouts, helping them attain what they desired.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of years ago, it hit me: time is running out. I worked to finish up badges that I needed to get to the rank of Life Scout, just one step below my goal.<\/p>\n<p>To be able to get Eagle, you must have all the needed badges, be in a leadership position within the troop for at least 6 months as a Life, and complete an Eagle project, which is probably one of the most time consuming requirements, all before you turn 18.<\/p>\n<p>In October of 2012, I found a possible project through a family friend. After two months of planning, the project fell through due to loss of communication with the project beneficiary. It took a couple weeks, but I finally found another, and it seems to be coming together quite well.<\/p>\n<p>Around the beginning of January, I got with the Westlink Public Library and have decided to build a couple of benches there. I have had this okayed by the Library for awhile now, but I just keep running into more and more complications. Remember how I said this had to be done before I turn 18? My birthday is on April 18, which is less than one month away, and I still have yet to get it approved by my troop, much less the council, who need to approve it before anything can be done with it.<\/p>\n<p>Now is definitely the time to panic. I am rushing to finish up everything and get people on my side It looks like I\u2019ll have to pay about $1000 out of pocket, and I also have to get the materials. Yay! All sarcasm aside; I can\u2019t believe how much six months could screw someone over.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>have been in Boy Scouts since I was six years old, and have had many goals for myself in scouting.
