Everything has a story and everything happens in a specific way for some reason. While jewelry has always been a way to have something physical to show off on your body, it also has significant meaning and symbolism. The meaning of jewelry varies based on the piece, materials used, the country, and the memories behind it. The value of jewelry changes with time and style.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;Every piece of jewelry that has ever belonged to someone has a story behind it and has seen some part of history. It\u2019s important to note that the value behind an item could be different for everyone some use it as a lucky charm, others use it as a way to remember that there is happiness still in this shattered world we live in.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u201cThe pin has served as a reminder of how happy I was and all the good friends I made back then,\u201d Jay Rangel, junior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Rangel said he believes that items hold a place in everyone\u2019s heart, and that they all have different meanings behind them. In the early ages of Rangel\u2019s life, he had a childhood friend and once they got separated she gave him a cat pin. The cat pin had shiny blue eyes and the rest of the cat was gold. The cat holds a small bell and has a ribbon, still gold, around its neck. <\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u201cThe cat pin became like a lucky charm of sorts, and at this point, if it was ever lost I&#8217;d feel like I&#8217;d have lost a piece of who I was along with it,\u201d Rangel said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Freshman Pablo Lopez said that he wouldn\u2019t be in the early college academy program if it has not been for his eighth-grade teacher who had a wide impact on him. Before Lopez left middle school, that teacher gave him a goldplated pin that says, drill team. Lopez said that before this teacher stepped up and became a positive role model for him, he never found anything interesting and always stayed inside.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u201cWithout that pin, my motivation would be completely gone, and I probably wouldn\u2019t be here at all,\u201d Lopez said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> Lopez expresses that if he were to lose the pin, he would be really upset because it has been the one thing that means a lot to him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u201cIt\u2019s been with me in the worst times of school and the best times of school.
