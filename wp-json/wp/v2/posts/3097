It states \u201cIf a student\/athlete has any combination of 3 D\u2019s and\/or F\u2019s there may be consequences. Consequences begin Tuesday of each week.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are mixed feelings about the requirements from students and some are more aware than others of the new rule that states that any combination of 3 D\u2019s or F\u2019s, will leave them ineligible to practice or play.<\/p>\n<p>But it isn\u2019t intended to be a punishment according to athletic director Lance Deckinger. He says it is a way to help students and their parents be more aware.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt just helps out the coaches and makes it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades,\u201d Deckinger said. \u201cWe\u2019re holding the kids accountable and have had a couple comments even from parents like \u2018I didn\u2019t even know my kid had these grades,\u2019 and it helps everyone keep an eye on what\u2019s important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Deckinger says the first week is a warning week to let athletes know they need to improve their grades.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re on it a second week, we\u2019ll see which direction your grades are going,\u201d Deckinger said, \u201cand if they\u2019re going in the wrong direction you\u2019re not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, then you can keep on playing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some students have already felt the effects of the new requirements, but aren\u2019t too upset. They just find themselves rushing to get things done so they can participate and support their team.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe list affects the soccer team because if you don\u2019t keep your grades up&#8230; the team\u2019s going to be one player down and they won\u2019t be complete,\u201d sophomore Jesus Morales said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had to miss one game. [Before] next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Students are well aware of the requirements for their grades, but fail to realize that absences can also define whether you play or not.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Code of Conduct, students must be in school to participate in a game or practice. If a student is excused for more than half of the day they are not allowed to participate in a practice and\/or game.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey send it [the list] out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that\u2019s always been a problem of knowing whether they\u2019re here or not,\u201d cheer coach Tiffany Houle said. \u201cIf they\u2019re not here that means no practice and no games.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><\/p>\n<p><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Absences, however, are also now defining whether you can participate or not.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe list affects the soccer team because if you don\u2019t keep your grades up you won\u2019t play. The team\u2019s going to be one player down and they won\u2019t be complete,\u201d said sophomore \u00a0Jesus Morales. \u201cI was on the D &amp; F list and I had to miss one game. (Before) next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>WE STARTED HAVING A D F LIST THIS YEAR. JUST MAKING SURE WE\u2019VE HAD STUDENTS IN THE PAST THAT WEREN\u2019T ALWAYS PASSING CLASSES<\/p>\n<p>AND IT\u2019S JUST IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU\u2019RE PASSING YOUR \u00a0CLASSES. AND DOING WHAT YOU\u2019RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HERE FOR YOUR EDUCATION BEFORE YOU\u2019RE DOING EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY.<\/p>\n<p>THE FIRST WEEK IS SORTA A WARNING WEEK, hey you got some grades down, get your grades up. IF YOU\u2019RE ON IT A SECOND WEEK WE\u2019LL SEE WHICH DIRECTION YOUR GRADES ARE GOING and if they\u2019re going to wrong direction, hey go get your grades up, your\u2019e not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, and then you can keep playing.<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You shouldn\u2019t probably be participating in co-curricular activities If you\u2019re having three or four ds or fs. So that\u2019s what started the list, so coaches and students could keep up with it. Because in the past when they had 4 5 ds and fs, they really shouldn\u2019t be on the field<\/p>\n<p>Everyone just got on the same page and said it\u2019s time to start improving it.<\/p>\n<p>when we had our accreditation this past year, every five years they have the accreditation, one of the things that came up was students, people who have low grades participating in co-curricular activities, why are these students, if they\u2019re having low grades, out there when they can\u2019t take care of their grades.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s helped out the coaches and made it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades. Holding the kids accountable and we\u2019ve had a couple comments even from parents like \u2018I didn\u2019t even my kid had these grades\u2019 and it helps everyone keep an eye on what\u2019s important.<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes it is helpful because I don\u2019t have to look it up myself, they send it out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that\u2019s always been a problem of knowing whether they\u2019re here or not. So I like that they send an attendance list every day so we know if they\u2019re in school. So if they\u2019re not here that means no practice, no games, which is nice because like I said, I used to have to look it up individually but now I don\u2019t have to do that because every week I\u2019m getting a list and I only have to find the girls that are getting Ds or Fs<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201c I\u2019m not a big fan, but you gotta do what you gotta do. To me it\u2019s just more paperwork that gets in the way of things. Is the concept good? Yes. Does it hold athletes to a higher standard? Yes. But we had less than one percent of athletes that have physicals turned in have issues with grades so I didn\u2019t really think it was necessary.\u201d said Cross Country coach Ron Russel<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Student athletes participating in fall sports for this year found themselves required to sign the Code of Player Conduct.
