Any spark and any enjoyment you once had is just gone one day. You just wake up and realize you feel different. And when you realize it, you scramble to find it again, something to stimulate you, or any feeling at all.<\/p>\n<p>Depression can make small things big, like lighthearted comment leaving a huge emotional impact, secretly confirming a secret insecurity. Depression can also make big things small, like brushing aside dark thoughts, your brain telling you \u201cYou know, they really wouldn\u2019t miss you. You annoy them anyways. If you can\u2019t make yourself happy, why don\u2019t you just do everyone else a favor?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You lie awake at night, thinking about all the wrongs you may have done unto others, thinking about how you could\u2019ve tried harder to keep everyone happy with you, they all hate you, probably. \u201cYou really aren\u2019t worth it, you deserve to be miserable,\u201d is all you can tell youself. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be happy again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being too sensitive. You\u2019re too weak, not strong enough to stay here anymore,\u201d you tell yourself over and over, when your mind should be on other things.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t stop thinking, about what you don\u2019t like about yourself, about how much easier it would be to end it, how grateful everyone would be to you.<\/p>\n<p>You think you\u2019re a waste of space and time, and no, this isn\u2019t the occasional feeling you get when you\u2019re down. This stays for weeks and weeks and that turns into months.<\/p>\n<p>And you\u2019re always, ALWAYS thinking. You can\u2019t stop. Not even to sleep or go to a movie with friends.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes you take it out on yourself, finding anything that burns or cuts you on the outside, taking it to your skin, over and over, until you\u2019re numb. Anything to give you any form of sensation or release. It becomes hard to feel and be affected by things.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to go out anymore. You\u2019re a joke to everyone. Even pain inflicted upon yourself doesn\u2019t let you feel anything.<\/p>\n<p>You get to a point where you don\u2019t want to move. You can\u2019t cry anymore. You\u2019ve given up, you\u2019re so disappointed in yourself. Everybody was always tells you to get over it, but you can&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>To yourself, you&#8217;re broken, a freak. Every negative comment and thought has been retained and repeated back, amplified. Everything they say about you must be based in truth, right? You agree with them, anything they say to you.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re just, uncomfortable, being yourself, feeling how you&#8217;re feeling. You feel crazy. You cry out of the frustration just a normal day give you. You\u2019re just so frustrated that you just can\u2019t be happy. You can\u2019t stand yourself. You have no right to be this unhappy.<\/p>\n<p>But the reality of it is, you physically can\u2019t help it.<\/p>\n<p>Depression is a disease, not an emotion. Many people don\u2019t realize its severity until its too late, and even then, many are left with questions.<\/p>\n<p>A person is not selfish for being affected by depression, or losing to it. To take your own life takes a lot of thought about everyone in your life, and is not selfish. It isn\u2019t selfish to reach out either, everybody deserves help.<\/p>\n<p>Depression, despite common belief, is not just being sad, or having a bad day. It is based in the chemistry of the brain, physically hindering a person&#8217;s happiness.<\/p>\n<p>Telling someone \u201cit\u2019s all in your head\u201d isn\u2019t going to make it any better or any easier, it won\u2019t magically cure a person if all you say is \u201ccheer up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If somebody tells you they&#8217;re feeling anything even close to this, GET THEM HELP.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel anything similar to this, GET HELP.<\/p>\n<p>It can be helped, no matter how terrible you feel, you can hang on a little longer.<\/p>\n<p>You deserve to feel happy again, and just as you began to feel depressed, you can begin to recover as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re stronger than you think you are, you can be helped.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s scary feeling like you\u2019re never going to be happy again.
