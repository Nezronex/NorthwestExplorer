After relying on this feeling for so long it can become an expensive habit. The world of a shopaholic can be a slippery slope into a ditch of denial and overspending that is hard to get out of. <\/p>\n<p>Some Northwest students can relate to the overwhelming feeling of accomplishment when walking out of a store with more than one bag.
