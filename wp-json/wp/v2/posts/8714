Just longer periods and that\u2019s annoying,\u201d Childs said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another change from middle school is lunch organization, everyone going at the same time. A benefit that seemed popular is being able to hang out with different grades.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI like being able to hang out with upperclassmen since there\u2019s not many cool freshmen,\u201d Childs said.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bright and early Monday morning, August 14, 2023, Northwest High school welcomed our freshmen.
