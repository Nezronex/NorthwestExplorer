Mia (Chloe Grace) and her family were in a brutal car crash that left her in a coma and the rest of her family dead. The movie is based off the idea that your destiny is what you choose. She is able to hear and see everything that goes on around her unresponsive body, and is left to make the choice to move on or to stay alive.<br \/>\nThe movie was based off of the novel by Gayle Forman, and stuck closely to the plot of the book. Since If I Stay is one of my favorite books, I rushed to see it in film. There\u2019s something about seeing the emotion play out on screen that hits you harder than any printed words could. This movie shows the raw emotion of family, friends, and personal struggles that come from a major life change, such as death. The sorrow and passion hits you like a brick to the face. If you go see this movie and have anything short of a heart of ice, you will be in tears. If you are anything like me, you will need a life jacket to swim out of your tears.<br \/>\nThis movie is a must see for the season. Whether you are in need of a good cry, or just want to torture your sappy significant other, this movie will give you your sentimental fix. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If I Stay, a film starring Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley, is an unconventional love story about a cellist and a rock star whose love is put under strain by a life disaster.
