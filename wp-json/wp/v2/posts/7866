Especially because people talk about the high school experience being out there and life-changing.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I&#8217;m just waiting for the day that they say we can go back to school because that will make me feel better,\u201d Daysha Ogunbiyi, senior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ogunbiyi expressed that she feels like online school is something that everyone needs to get used to. Ogunbiyi explained that as a senior this is not how she wanted to spend her last year in high school. Ogunbiyi said that she and her fellow classmates are just waiting on the day students are allowed to go back in person.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also explained that because she\u2019s a senior she\u2019s missing out on last dances, no first day of senior year, making new friends, visiting colleges, talking to the guidance counselors, and just having the overall high school experience for one last time.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Losing motivation is something that can happen when you have high expectations; staying on task when at home can be extremely stressful or disruptive depending on what environment someone is in. It\u2019s common to be able to not learn very quickly or effectively on the laptops this year because it\u2019s still semi all-new, Ogunbiyi said when explaining that she had an easier time losing motivation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSomething that isn\u2019t so good about online learning for students\u2019 mental health is definitely the new socialization rules or ways of socializing\u201d freshman Kylie Olsen, said.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olsen said that she has heard from other students that remote schooling has a positive effect on students\u2019 organization skills, but she has not had as much trouble with the organization as most people. Olsen said that if there was a chance where she could go back and it would be safe for everyone she would take the offer. Olsen said she believes that being in person when at school is better for her because she thinks that staying focused is less challenging. Online school may not be the most ideal citation for some but for others, it may seem to work better making it to where their motivation goes up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think online school is going well so far; It\u2019s not ideal but we are making the best out of a bad situation.\u201d Emmarie Nickel, Senior.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nickel explained in an online interview that she understands that safety is what is important, regardless of if it\u2019s what people like or not. Nickel also said she understands the importance of getting the high school experience and getting to do activities, but in an instance where people have a chance of getting sick, it\u2019s best to keep safe and not go out and have fun. She said missing the social aspect of the school is something that crosses her mind quite often, but regardless of this, she would continue to stay online because it\u2019s safe and she can enjoy the comfort of her own bed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Olsen explained that although it is challenging to do some of the activities people might have been looking forward to this year. It is also in the best interest of the people to stay online for schooling because it lowers the likelihood of more people getting sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEducation is our passport to the future, it takes us to success and makes the people in this world life changers for some\u201d Olsen, Freshmen.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Going into the school year and finding out that you\u2019re not able to go back in person can be frustrating to some, relieving to others.
