He\u2019s not on Facebook or Twitter like most other teens, instead he\u2019s on sites like kake.com and kwch.com searching for recent stories on his favorite, now closed theme park, Joyland.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNothing has come up recently but every story that I do read, I go to the comments and there\u2019s always like 80 to 160 comments from people about how they want to get together as a city and raise money and go in and fix it and reopen it someday,\u201d East Said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered why no one has taken that initiative and pushed the idea further than just the text. So basically the idea is just a big fundraiser throughout the city and maybe some private corporations to buy the park, refurbish it and reopen it in late 2012 or early 2013.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A while back East tried to circulate a petition to reopen Joyland but soon learned that a petition would do no good. When the park owners have no money there is nothing that can be done without the city\u2019s help. Joyland is a very significant symbol in East\u2019s life. It means more to him than just simple worn down rides. He wouldn\u2019t be the person he is today if not for that amusement park.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJoyland is the driving force behind the reason I want to design rides. I rode that rollercoaster at Joyland when I was two and ever since then, I\u2019ve been into amusement parks. So I know my story behind it and I know that a lot of other people in the city have emotional attachments to it as well, since they grew up with it over the years,\u201d East said.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since that first ride on a roller coaster when he was two, East has been fascinated with them, especially their design. Supported by his friends and family, East dreams of becoming an engineer and wants to eventually build the roller coasters he is designing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI plan on going to K-State and studying architectural engineering and then eventually after that I would probably go up to the Philadelphia Toboggan Company; they design roller coasters and stuff like that,\u201d East said.<\/p>\n<p>For others wanting to follow in East\u2019s footsteps, here\u2019s his advice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDo really well in math because it\u2019s a lot of math. I don\u2019t like math, but you need to work on math,\u201d East said.<\/p>\n<p>But studying math isn\u2019t the only thing that East does in his free time, he loves to build roller coasters.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI like to know how things work so I can build them from my perspective,\u201d East said.<\/p>\n<p>His knowledge on how things work and his drive to build things has focused on roller coasters from a young age.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t build the first one I got. My parents bought me a mini Ferris Wheel when I was two,\u201d East said. \u201cWhen I could start building things I picked it up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the years East has accumulated about 6800 K\u2019Nex through birthdays and other holidays. This led to the creation of a model roller coaster that has given him some attention. Taking about 5 days to build, this model is more then a simple hobby.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been on TV twice and shown in the event at Exploration Place,\u201d East said. \u201cWhen it was on TV in 2008, the people from Exploration Place saw it and contacted me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even though his model roller coaster has gained him attention he still has one big goal in mind.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf I could accomplish one thing in my life it would be to reopen Joyland,\u201d East said. \u201cIt\u2019s a place easy to call home.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Junior Alex East sits at his computer surfing the web.
