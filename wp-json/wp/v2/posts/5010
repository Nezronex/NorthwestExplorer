Northwest High School has had its doors open for the past 38 years and has had developments in the academics, scheduling, and construction of the building. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English teacher Ann Burgett has been a part of the Northwest faculty for 23 years after taking some time off in 2008, and has witnessed the change of the school first-hand. Burgett also taught when the school did not have a block schedule. She said that the classes were 50 minutes long and students received a larger workload. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think we got a lot done in that time period, because you saw those kids every single day,\u201d Burgett said. \u201cSo I felt like I expected a lot more from them because they knew the next day what was going on and we didn\u2019t have to go back and re-teach anything.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burgett also said the curriculum has not changed dramatically throughout the years and that Northwest has always been focused on preparing students for college readiness. Even though she has been through the many different tardy policies and teaching styles, the most noticeable change for her was the construction of the building. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of add-ons to the school,\u201d Burgett said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to principal Gil Alvarez, the new additions of the school has added approximately 58,000 square feet onto the building. Northwest is approximately 308,341 square feet of building. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything must develop with time, and the school is no exception. As the years have gone by, the school has become more modernized. Burgett explains how the school slowly gained and obtained computers, overheads, PowerPoints, and Smart Boards, and how these items have affected the students. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTechnology helps make kids expect more because without the technology they would have to be creative in different ways,\u201d Burgett said. \u201cWith technology it\u2019s easier to be creative with doing certain things. I think that makes a big difference.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business teacher Georgia Rovenstine, has also been working at Northwest for over a decade. She has seen changes in technology, but said that the social patterns of students are still the same. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Rovenstine has been a teacher at Northwest since 1997, she has also seen minor changes in not only the students, but also in the parents in their opinion of ways of teaching. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rovenstine has also noticed specific rules that have changed, similar to Burgett. The advancement Rovenstine noticed more was cellphones, since they weren\u2019t as used as much 20 years ago as they are now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cParents have a harder time supporting the cell phone policy because they want to get a hold of their kids,\u201d Rovenstine said. \u201cSo we see less parent support because they don\u2019t really understand the principle or reasoning behind it themselves.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also describes the similarities and differences in the choice of clothing style of students. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a cleavage problem because the clothing style has changed,\u201d Rovenstine said. \u201cThere\u2019s less clothing on the top and bottom. There [were] also no yoga pants. I went to school in the 70s and it was the same in the 70s because the style was halter tops, the shorts were very short, and mini skirts were around.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burgett and Rovenstine share the same opinion about how students had more of a workload in the past years. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[The] classes I teach are computer classes, so if kids couldn\u2019t get the work done they had to come in after class anyway because they still didn\u2019t have the software,\u201d Rovenstine said. \u201cMath has got a pretty good homework load now, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s more homework now than what there was at that point.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Burgett, even though Northwest has gone through major developments since 1978, it still has the same core and goal. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[We] still have high expectations which Northwest has always asked for,\u201d Burgett said. \u201cThey ask for excellence and that\u2019s what they expect from the students and that\u2019s what the rules stand by.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since 1978, the home of the Grizzlies has undergone minor and major changes.
