Italian exchange student Giulia Putti and French exchange student Eloise Rech gave the class a look into what education is like in their home countries, including how the French Revolution is taught. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dennis Cox, the class\u2019 instructor, values exposure to cultures in other countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think culture is an invaluable lesson,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I enjoy traveling and taking students to Europe, for them to see the other cultures of the world and to see how history evolved there.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putti was thrilled to have the opportunity to share about her own learning experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think it\u2019s the best thing ever to learn [about other cultures],\u201d Putti said. \u201cI think that you don\u2019t learn only by studying books, but you learn by talking to people. So I really liked this.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exchange students agreed that studying \u00a0in American schools is less challenging than European ones. In both Italy and France, admission into college all depends on one difficult test, on top of daily oral and written exams in class. Additionally, sleeping or phone use during class could result in suspension.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cox is surprised by the rigor of European schools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe thing that amazed me is when they shared about their schooling and the demand on their education versus the demand in America,\u201d Cox said. \u201cTheirs is a lot more demanding.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putti noted that she learned in elementary school the material currently being taught in Northwest\u2019s Spanish four course. Nonetheless, living in the United States has been a learning experience for her.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI learned how people have different attitudes, and people\u2019s tradition, their culture and how to be a member of a family,\u201d Putti said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely different. It\u2019s interesting to see how people relate to each other.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Holly Brown says that hearing from the exchange students was a learning experience for her as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI gained a new perspective on how they learn in Italy and France,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt helps me have a more widespread understanding about what\u2019s going on around the world and not just in the United States.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putti is looking forward to giving a new perspective to another class besides Cox\u2019s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m very excited because now the teacher of government asked me if I can do a presentation about Italy,\u201d Putti said. \u201cI get to talk about my country. I\u2019m very happy when someone asks me for my opinion.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>AP Euro students received a unique lecture during seventh hour on Tuesday, Nov. 10.
