If you want to go be prepared to wait in a long line of cars!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: I would give this a 3.5. I would give it this rating because not everyone in the cul-de-sac had their houses decorated and it kind of sucked waiting in a 30 minutes line just to see the lights for like 4 minutes. The radio station also did not work well; it was very static and choppy sounding. Other than that the decorations were amazing and so much amazing work went into this.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reindeer road<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Location: N Firefly St, Wichita, KS 67235&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information: Reindeer road is a street right next to candy cane lane. Each yard that participates in the holiday decorations has a large reindeer in their yard ranging from 9-15 feet tall. If you go to this street be prepared to wait in a long line!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: I would rate this a 4. I really liked how they had reindeers in their yard to go with the reindeer road theme. Like the candy cane lane it was kind of sad that there were multiple houses that did not decorate or had minimum decoration and it was also a very long wait just to drive by it very fast.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christmas at the Mckinneys\u2019<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Location: 1452 N Coolidge, Wichita, KS 67203<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information: Christmas at the Mckinneys\u2019 is a family who decorates their yard every year with 150,000 lights! They also share their decorations with their neighbors yard. All of the lights go with radio station 89.7 where the lights go to the music making an amazing light show! This is a free thing to see but donations are accepted. All of the donations go to the Kansas Humane Society and HumanKind.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: I would rate this a 5. There is literally nothing bad I can say about this light show. There was not a long line, the music was good and the lights were outstanding! This was an amazing place to go see lights and I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9th street lights<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Location: 3821 W 9th St, Wichita, KS 67203<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information: 9th street lights have more than 35,000 lights paired up with radio station 101.7 to make an amazing light show of lights that go with the music. They play many classic songs that all of their lights go to!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rating: I would give this light show a 4.5 rating. I would only take .5 off because I wish I was in a better spot to experience everything better. Overall it was an amazing experience and I would definitely go back again! It was a smaller house with a huge light show that was very entertaining and amazing! I would recommend this to anyone. There was no line, just a few others there to see the lights as well.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Candy cane lane Location: N Azure circle, Wichita, KS 67235 Information: This a cul-de-sac that all goes together to decorate their houses with tons of Christmas decorations.
