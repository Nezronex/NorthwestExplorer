Hopefully next summer I\u2019ll get a lot of the West Coast knocked out.<\/p>\n<p>Last summer I wanted to hit Atlanta and Tampa Bay. We flew into Atlanta on June 2<sup>nd&nbsp;<\/sup>and watched Atlanta play the Washington Nationals the next day. After the game we drove to Stone Mountain to see a carving that was done by the same guy that did Mount Rushmore. It really wasn\u2019t much and to be honest it was kind of a waste of time and money. Later that day we continued our trip to Athens, Georgia.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6453\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6453\" style=\"width: 357px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20371.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6453 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20371-357x475.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"357\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20371-357x475.jpg 357w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20371-768x1023.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20371-676x900.jpg 676w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20371-300x400.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20371.jpg 1127w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russell and his wife, Connie, at the Sun Trust stadium in Atlanta, Georgia<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6454\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6454\" style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20391.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-6454 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20391-475x356.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20391-475x356.jpg 475w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20391-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20391-900x675.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20391-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20391-160x120.jpg 160w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20391.jpg 1501w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6454\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A picture that Russell took of Stone Mountain<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>I am a huge fan of the band R.E.M.

It probably had the most accessible beach and a ton of history. This is where we saw the Tampa Bay Rays play.&nbsp;Florida baseball stadiums are a little strange. They (Marlins stadium in Miami was the same way) have these beautiful stadiums, very good teams, and nobody goes. I would guess the attendance at our game was in the 5,000 people range. Concessions were relatively cheap, the seats were great and only cost us about $20 a piece, and access to the stadium was also free (a shuttle from our hotel).<\/p>\n<figure style=\"width: 475px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20941.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-6459\" src=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20941-475x357.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20941-475x357.jpg 475w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20941-768x577.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20941-900x676.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20941-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20941-160x120.jpg 160w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_20941.jpg 1501w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Russell and his wife at Tropicana Field watching the Rays play<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The next day we drove back to Atlanta.
