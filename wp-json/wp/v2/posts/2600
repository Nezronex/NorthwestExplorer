We communicate through our iPhones and smart phones more than we talk to people face to face. The dangers of hacking and identity theft have become so much more relevant.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I probably won\u2019t ever be hacked, nothing like that happens to me. Says every person ever.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Social networks are great, sure. They help us connect with old friends, send funny photos, and just be able to talk to friends in the spur of the moment- anywhere, anytime. Having that availability at the tip of our fingers is incredibly convenient, so it is needless to say we use that to our advantage.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People are so caught up in the hype of social networks that no one ever reads the terms and policies anymore. We just assume because everyone has an account, it\u2019s safe. So we just freely give our personal information to the company and start snapping those chats, or posting a picture on Instagram with little to no thought about where it\u2019s going or how it\u2019s being used.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Take Snapchat for instance. Their big seller is the fact that once a picture is sent, it is deleted.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201c&#8230;making communication between any two parties fleeting, with no record left of the content, within the constraints of modern technology,\u201d said Snapchat on their terms and policies.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Notice the part, \u201cwithin the constraints of modern technology\u201d. So basically they\u2019re saying that it most likely won\u2019t get deleted. Everything you put on the Internet within \u201cmodern technology\u201d is permanently there, you just can\u2019t always see it.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So before you accept to a media network\u2019s terms, read between the lines a little, because that\u2019s where all their secrets lie. Don\u2019t think just because you hide something on the Internet it can\u2019t be accessed, because once you put it on there it\u2019s never going to truly go away. There are some insanely genius people out there who hack your \u201chidden\u201d stuff for a hobby.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you feel a bit on edge when it comes to \u00a0a social network\u2019s terms, do some research first. You\u2019d be surprised what you\u2019ll find.<\/p>\n<p>After all, you can find anything on the Internet.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"The Danger of Reading\" href=\"http:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/opinion\/2014\/01\/14\/2603\/\">Related story by Whitney Clum.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Internet has pretty much become our number one source of anything.
