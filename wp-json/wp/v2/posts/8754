It was a really educating experience because I learned how important it was to use your time well and create a story that draws attention. My favorite part was probably getting to just walk around and see other people having a good time hanging out with each other despite the rain. All the moods were high,\u201d Aubrynn Lindrey (12) said .<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Video team had three topics: Small business, First Aid, and Agriculture, which they then had to create thirty second clips of each representing the topic.
