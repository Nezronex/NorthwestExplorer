Then, we\u2019re going to shift into sessions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Four 20-minute informative sessions will begin at 6:45 p.m. The information in the different meetings will apply particularly to each grade.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWe\u2019re offering a variety of different sessions mainly to allow students and parents to talk to people together,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping this can be a time where parents and students can come together and get information, and help them feel like they\u2019re well informed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The sessions will be specific to each grade level, but it is not mandatory to attend any certain session.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt\u2019s not like you have to stay right in your 11th grade track or right in your 12th grade track,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cYou can kind of mix and match.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is something in store for everyone who attends Family Engagement Night.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to have Wichita Area Technical College and Hutchinson Community College donate scholarships,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have other goodies&#8211;drink coupons from Quik Trip, t-shirts&#8211;just some other fun stuff that people can win for coming out for our program.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the first time Northwest will be hosting this event, and most likely not the last.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMr. Alvarez kind of gave us the challenge to provide a night for our families,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cSo we decided to do this first. Hopefully next fall we\u2019ll be providing a career for our students as well. This is going to be something we do every year, kind of a fun way for everyone to feel educated.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Family Engagement Night will be hosted in the Northwest commons, which includes a free dinner and a college career fair.
