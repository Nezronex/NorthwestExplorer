Graduated 2 of our 3 runners, and then Bryce Griggs moved to Georgia. The kids we do have coming back are hard working. Many athletic sophomores.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>NE: Any runners we should keep an eye on?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>RR: Gabby Reyna, she had a great summer; Alysa Frosto? From Maize South, she\u2019s outstanding. Just as fast as Gabby in the mile, faster in the 800. Cross country she isn\u2019t as fast, but she\u2019s a hard worker. Then all the returning girls, Anna Kunz, state qualifier, Madeline Keller. Great freshman girls class, probably the best ever. And that\u2019s saying alot because we&#8217;ve had a lot of really good ones.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>NE: Any races you\u2019re looking forward to?<br \/>\nRR: Southeast is where we\u2019ll really get to show our full strength.
