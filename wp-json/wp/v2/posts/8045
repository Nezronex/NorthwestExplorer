With many receivers leaving, others have had to step up. The Northwest receiver core is expected to be explosive and show signs of great speed. The receiving squad has built a nice core with many returning players expected to have bigger roles. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trenton Salisbury (11) has shown great potential and sees himself getting many reps and being a consistent target. Randall Bell (12) who used to play quarterback then switched to receiver is very excited for the new season.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;\u201cThe way we\u2019re able to adjust this year, and mess with the defense will make us really nice this year,\u201d Bell stated when asked about his wide receiver group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Michael Lopez, who is the receivers coach&#8217;s son, is expected to have a big role on the team this year. Many of his teammates have said his speed is incredible and has explosive acceleration. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kealis Miles has another bright spot in the receiving core. His broad body type and athletic skills will make him a force on the Grizzlies offense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When asking Miles some of his personal goals this year he stated \u201cI want to overall become a better blocker for my teammates, so I can be as two dimensional as possible. And I want to have a reception each game of the season.\u201d Miles is a great example of a team player and the Grizzlies are glad to have him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the season starting very soon, fans and students will be able to see all of what the receivers can put on the table.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Northwest the past couple of years have had a good group of wide receivers to throw to.
