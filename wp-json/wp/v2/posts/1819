The school usually has a ceremony of some sort where students gather and pray. The story makes the news, trends on Twitter and becomes the latest controversy on Facebook. Suddenly, everyone in the United States becomes familiar with the name and story. Everyone is heartbroken. Students from the high school are interviewed and they all say things about \u2018how she was so pretty\u2019 or \u2018he was the nicest guy ever\u2019 or \u2018so many of us were your friends, and we all loved you so much.\u2019 But if that was really the case, then why did this person feel the need to end their life? Why did this person commit suicide because she\/he was being bullied at school? Why does everyone all of sudden like this person, when they are dead? Where were we when this person actually needed us, and probably begged for us to be there for them? Why did this person feel so alone and like everyone hated them if \u2018so many of us were your friends, and we all loved you so much\u2019?<br \/>\nTeen suicide has sadly become so popular and common that it\u2019s not unusual to hear of a story about another teen who decided to hang themselves, or overdose on pills or put a bullet right through their skull. In fact, suicide is so common today that it is ranked the third leading cause of death among the ages of 15-24, and is the fourth leading cause of death among 10-14 year olds (teensuicidestatistics.com.) To give you even more chills, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, it is reported that the suicide rate among the ages 15-24 has increased 6 percent and ages 10-14 the rate has increased 100 percent.<br \/>\nLet\u2019s go back to this cliche statement \u2018so many of us were your friends, we all loved you so much.\u2019 Why didn\u2019t any of you stand up for this teenager that was clearly being bullied? If so many of you cared and loved this human being then why did none of you try to help? Teensuicide.us claims that each person who ends up committing suicide has actually attempted suicide 25 times. 25 times. How did all of this go unseen? All of the warning signs just didn\u2019t exist? No. They existed, but you ignored them. You didn\u2019t think it was that serious. You didn\u2019t want to look like a \u2018loser\u2019 talking to the person who got bullied every day at school. But now that the person is dead, you care.<br \/>\nThe Amanda Todd story is a perfect example. On September 7, a 15 year old girl from Vancouver, Canada uploaded a video to YouTube. The video was in black and white with her face out of the frame, she held oversized note cards to the camera that contained writing on them, thoroughly explaining what she had been through. After watching the video you learn about her story. She ends the video with a card that says \u2018I have nobody, I need someone.\u2019 On October 10, just a little over a month after posting this video she was dead.<br \/>\nNow her name is trending on Twitter. There are Facebook statuses about her. People are making tweets, saying how much they will miss her, and how much they cared and loved her. She begged for someone to be there for her, and nobody came to her side. She sat alone at lunch. And this video floated around YouTube for 33 days, and she still felt alone. She still killed herself after pleading for a friend.<br \/>\nIt happens in almost every suicidal teen case. The teenager gets popular after they die. The whole student body is suddenly their best friend. Now everyone wants to be there for him\/her. Everyone wants to bring him\/her back. It. Is. Too. Late. We start caring once the person is dead. We want to reach out to the person once he\/she is dead. We have to actually care when the person has a beating heart. Usually all it takes is one person to prevent the lonely and depressed teen from killing themselves.<br \/>\nThe number of suicidal deaths is almost as high as homicide and HIV\/AIDS deaths combined (web4health.info.) 19.3% of high school students have seriously considered killing themselves, and 14.5% of high schoolers have actually attempted suicide according to teensuicidestatistics.com. These percentages are simply too high, especially among our age group. Our life hasn\u2019t even begun in high school. We have so much to live for, so much more to experience and enjoy. We have to start taking things more seriously. We never know when a person from our English class is planning on going home and ending everything.<br \/>\nWe can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late, and then start caring. Once they\u2019re dead, unfortunately there\u2019s no bringing them back. Care when there\u2019s a chance of prevention. We shouldn\u2019t be used to hearing stories about how teens were pushed to the edge and they committed suicide. We need to make this less common.<br \/>\nInstead of making tweets with the hashtag \u2018RIPAMANDA\u2019 we should\u2019ve been hashtagging \u201cAmandaImHereForYou\u2019 the day that video leaked to YouTube, then maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been too late. Instead of holding candles and roses in remembrance of someone we should watch them blow out birthday candles and celebrate a new year with them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It usually ends with a neighborhood full of people caressing candles in their hands, tears running down cheeks, dozens and dozens of flowers everywhere and a portrait of the deceased.
