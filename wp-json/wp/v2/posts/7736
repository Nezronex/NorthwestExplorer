But Covid-19 has not stopped the debate team from progressing and moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every year, the debate club chooses a topic to learn about and discuss in debates. This year, the topic is criminal justice. The students then prepare evidence and pair up with another student to face off with another student pair in front of at least one adult judge. But now, instead of doing the debates in-person, the debates take place within organized and structured Zoom meetings. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A strong group of debaters has made overcoming this challenge easier according to the debate coach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have an incredible group this year,\u201d said debate teacher, Peter Crevoiserat, who is better known as Mr. Crevo. \u201cI have more students in debate this year than any of my previous years, which is exciting, and I hope that trend continues. (&#8230;) If more people stick with debate, the sky&#8217;s the limit.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Makayla Coy says debating this year is challenging, but still rewarding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA typical debate meeting now is kind of crazy from what it used to be,\u201d Coy said.\u201d \u201cThis was me and my partner\u2019s first year, so we\u2019ve gotten a grip on things. It\u2019s been hard, but if you put your mind to it then it\u2019s okay. (&#8230;) Other than that debate is great and I\u2019m glad I joined it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team has gone to three tournaments thus far, placing 3rd in two tournaments overall. The current top pair, consisting of Rylee Lopez and Josee Hoshaw, have placed in every tournament. Taking 2nd place at the Ad Astra tournament, 5th place at Wichita East, and 3rd place at Salina South. The pair consisting of Tristan Rice and Jack Rue took 4th place in Salina South.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Crevo stated that this has been a great season so far for the debate team, he just needs more participants.
