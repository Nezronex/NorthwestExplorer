With most of the students who have jobs being upperclassmen they are trying to raise money for college and for their future all while trying to maintain good grades and a social <\/span>life as a young teen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Chloe Hoyt, a junior, works at Quik Trip and on average works 18 hours a week. When asked if she finds it hard to balance school and work she stated how it is hard for her.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYes it is super hard because the days that I don\u2019t have practice, I\u2019m working from 4 to 11 so I <\/span>have almost no time for homework which is getting harder as the school year has started for sure,\u201d stated Hoyt.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some students at Northwest work a little more than part time hours which can be challenging for them to find time to fit in homework and extracurricular activities. Reagan Faulkner, a senior, works two jobs and works anywhere from 15 to 30 hours a week.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhenever I can fit them in. Mainly Friday and Saturday nights I try to keep open for me to do stuff with friends\/ family, and Sundays for homework if I don\u2019t get it done during the week,\u201d stated Faulkner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outside of keeping students very busy working on top of school, it can also affect students&#8217; mental health and social lives. Rylee Lopez, a senior, works around 25 hours a week and feels that work keeps her busy but it also affects her in ways outside of school.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt definitely affects my social life because the rest of my friends also work, so our schedules rarely align. My mental health is affected by it because I feel stressed, but I\u2019d rather stay busy than be bored\u201d Stated Lopez.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who work during the school year tend to stay very busy trying to balance their social lives, school, and work all together. Although that can be challenging, many students find ways to make it happen so that they can succeed in all aspects of their life.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many students at Northwest high school have part time jobs during the school year which can be challenging.
