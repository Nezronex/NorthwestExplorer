With Covid cases on the rise, many believe both masks and vaccines should be mandated while others are completely against it and think they should be able to decide what\u2019s best for their safety. In Wichita Public School\u2019s this has been a big debate, especially because of the board&#8217;s decision to start the school year off with masks being strongly recommended instead of mandating them like they have in the past. We asked people how they felt about this policy and here is what some had to say.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that it is kind of political in asking people to require to wear masks, although I think if we just all do it then it would get this over a lot quicker. We should\u2019ve done this last year, although lots of people do not always follow directions.\u201d an anonymous source said.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people agree with this statement, others have different opinions, such as an anonymous freshman who understands why the mask policy is what it is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c I think the policy is pretty fair because everybody has a choice instead of it being forced upon people,\u201d stated&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As well as the topic of masks many people have strong opinions on vaccines, such as Mr. Mays, the choir teacher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;\u201cI\u2019m very pro-vaccine. I think vaccines work, and I think honestly that probably we should get it mandated&nbsp; for the schools because that&#8217;s what we\u2019ve been doing&nbsp; for decades. We\u2019ve been having kindergarteners that have had to have several vaccines before they could ever show up and so if we wanted to really nip it in the bud we could do that,\u201d stated Mays.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alondra Mena-Chavez, a Sophomore, has a very similar opinion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think they are helping \u2018cause most of the people dying from covid are the ones without the vaccine,\u201d stated Mena-Chavez.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Reagan Faulkner, a senior, has a very contrasting view on how she feels about the COVID vaccine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;\u201cNo, because I don\u2019t trust them because of the side effects and because I\u2019ve seen the numbers of people who have been paralyzed, had miscarriages, have adverse effects, heart attacks, all of that,\u201d stated Faulkner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a different note, there\u2019s many reasons as to why people choose to or don\u2019t choose to wear a mask.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI do not, just because I just don&#8217;t feel comfortable wearing it. I feel like I&#8217;m safe. I\u2019ve had covid before but it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal for me. I know people that have personally been affected by it, badly, but I just feel like I don&#8217;t need it,\u201d stated an anonymous source.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast to this we have Rubi Loya, a sophomore, who said, \u201cI choose to wear a mask to not only protect myself and my family, but also those around me and so I can keep coming to school and not have to quarantine.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has their own opinion, some are pro, others are against. In the end this is a rough time of everyone&#8217;s lives and it will take everyone being together to make the rough times a little easier. Following guidelines regardless of opinions is one way to be in this together.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In recent times, the topic of masks and vaccines has been really popular.
