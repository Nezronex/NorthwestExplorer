But what are they watching? After asking around Northwest, here are the results. (Results are listed in no particular order)<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Doctor Who<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a special year for the \u201cWhovians\u201d; Doctor Who is celebrating fifty years of being on the air, making it the longest-running sci-fi series of all time. Doctor Who started in the nineteen-sixties, was cancelled, brought back on the air with a TV movie, and finally rebooted in 2006.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The show follows the adventures of the Doctor, an alien who travels throughout time and space in his TARDIS with his human companions. Full of memorable characters, smart plot lines and moments that make you cry your eyes out, Doctor Who is not only a good show, it is a good story.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Famous Quote:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Come on, look at me! No plan, no backup, no weapons worth a damn, oh, and something else I don&#8217;t have: anything to lose! So, if you&#8217;re sitting up there in your silly little space ships with all your silly little guns, and you&#8217;ve got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight, just remember who&#8217;s standing in your way! Remember every black day I ever stopped you, and then, and then, do the smart thing! Let somebody else try first. -The 11th Doctor, Season Five: The Pandorica Opens<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trailer: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9vIsQ25Krq8\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9vIsQ25Krq8<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b006q2x0\">http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b006q2x0<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Whitney<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Merlin<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although it often gets overshadowed by other BBC shows, Merlin was the first show for a very long time to air on a major American TV broadcaster: NBC. Although it ended last Christmas with an amount of viewers to rival Doctor Who, people are still watching it on Netflix. The show puts a twist on the King Arthur Legend: Arthur and Merlin are the same age, and magic is punishable by death in Camelot. Every character changes immensely throughout the series and each has a secret. The relationships are \u00a0done tastefully, the plots were excellent, friendship between the characters made the show, and the snappy dialogue set it apart from other medieval shows. The US tagline for the show says it best: Some fight for justice, others fight for power, all fight for Camelot. Personally, out of all the TV shows on this list, Merlin is my favorite.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Famous Quote:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The love that binds us is more important than the power we wield. -Mordred, Season Five: Arthur\u2019s Bane Part Two<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trailer: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eBWbU5BvA0o\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eBWbU5BvA0o<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b00mjlxv\">http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b00mjlxv<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Whitney<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Star Trek: TOS<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have not seen this series, \u00a0you have been living under a rock. While it was canceled after its third season back in the 60\u2019s, it became a cult classic, resulting in five spin-off TV series, two movies set in an alternate timeline and 10 original movies. The series follows Captain Kirk, \u00a0Mr. Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and other memorable crew members of the starship Enterprise as they explore the galaxy and new civilizations. Star Trek has well-formed characters and original plotlines that really make you think- something that really sets it apart. If you have not seen Star Trek, why are you still reading this? Go and catch up on what you have been missing.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Famous Quote:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You may find that having is so pleasing a thing as wanting. This is not logical, but often true.-Mr. Spock, Amok Time<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trailer: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k8bY619HLQc\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k8bY619HLQc<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Whitney<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Pretty Little Liars<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s getting intense for all those PLL fanatics. A\u2019s identity is close to being \u00a0revealed. In this TV drama\/ thriller, four friends come together to discover an anonymous enemy who threatens the safety of all their darkest secrets, masking itself as A. Throughout this series, these friends come close to unraveling their best friend Alison DiLarentis&#8217; murder, while on many occasions, they come close to their own demise. Lately, it&#8217;s hard to know who\u2019s telling the truth and who isn&#8217;t, who\u2019s in cahoots with A and who\u2019s not. Secrets are coming out and relationships are being tested, while lines are being crossed and mysteries are bubbling to the surface. This TV mystery definitely keeps you at the edge of your seat. You never know who\u2019s next on A\u2019s list.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Famous Quote:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;The rich girls steal, the pretty girls lie, the smart girls play dumb and the dumb girls spend their days trying to be all of the above.&#8221; &#8211; Caleb, Season Three: Episode 14.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trailer:<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OOXKM7eImSY\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OOXKM7eImSY<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Allison<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-The Walking Dead<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Based on a comic book series by Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead \u00a0follows a group of humans on the run in Georgia after a zombie apocalypse. Something that makes the series unique is that \u00a0the The Walking Dead focuses on human nature and portrays it very accurately. It shows a side of people only brought out by the worst of times. Characters develop beautifully if not always the way we want them to, but insanity is made to be beautiful through the story and excellent writing\u201d instead of the cut-zombies-in-two approach. While the show doesn\u2019t exactly have a consistent cast of characters, there are quite a few fan favorites, which says something about the writers: they can consistently come up with good and complex characters.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Famous Quote: You are going to beat this world, I know you will. You are smart, and you are strong, and you are so brave, and I love you. You gotta do what&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s so easy to do the wrong thing in this world. So, so, if it feels wrong don&#8217;t do it, alright? If it feels easy don&#8217;t do it, don&#8217;t let this world spoil you. -Lori, \u00a0Season Three: Killer Within<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trailer: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FSi2fJALDyQ\">http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FSi2fJALDyQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Whitney<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-Sherlock<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sherlock is a mini-series based on the short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. \u00a0The series is set in modern-day London, and features the iconic duo of Sherlock Holmes and Captain John Watson chasing criminals, solving cases, getting themselves into the weirdest situations (showing up in Buckingham palace in a bedsheet) and unraveling the mystery that is professor Moriarty. The series is hilarious, there are memorable one-liners, fantastic actors, \u00a0incredibly twisted plots and \u00a0horrifying season finales. All in all, Sherlock is something that can appeal to anyone and everyone, including me.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Quote:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Listen, John what I said before, I meant it.
