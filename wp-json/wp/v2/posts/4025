As the offices were redone, administrators and clerical staff were required to temporarily set up in B hall classrooms. The transition back to new offices has been difficult for staff members whose jobs require a stable work environment. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of work to get everything back [into the office],\u201d registrar Mary Lea said, \u201cand it\u2019s been very stressful because we had to do enrollment down out of a classroom, and the work continues; we continue having new people every day, all day long&#8230; it\u2019s just a little bit hectic.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the stress of moving into new classrooms and offices is far outweighed by the benefits these spaces will provide, according to business teacher Jeff Darr. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One significant improvement in the business and FACS halls is the addition of floor-to-ceiling walls, eliminating the former \u201copen-concept\u201d design from the days when Northwest was first built. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt is so nice [to have walls],\u201d FACS teacher Alison Draut said. \u201cBefore it was sometimes interesting to hear the other classroom or the other teacher talking or a movie, and now those issues should be more limited.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Draut, among many others, is excited by the possibilities of her new culinary classroom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[It] is a great addition to Northwest. I\u2019m really excited to be in this new room,\u201d Draut said. \u201cI think this will help my students possibly feel more professional in the classroom and in their labs, so they can also think the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cSummer break\u201d had a slightly shorter meaning for faculty this year, as many staff members began the school year setting up long-awaited classrooms and offices from the bond project. \u00a0 Bond construction, largely completed now, has given the business, fine arts, and FACS departments several additional classrooms, and updated offices to administration and clerical staff&#8230;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":4026,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"ngg_post_thumbnail":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[459,4,12],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4025"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4025"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4025\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4027,"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4025\/revisions\/4027"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/4026"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4025"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4025"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4025"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
