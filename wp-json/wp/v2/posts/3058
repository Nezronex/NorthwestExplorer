She noticed, however, the group of students present was smaller than normal.<\/p>\n<p>As she found a seat amongst the concert choir students, the metal door swung open.<\/p>\n<p>The Madrigals filed in, including senior Blake Ellis with his guitar and senior Angelyn Montanez with her viola. Four soloists stood in front of the piano as senior Chris Bond sat on the bench behind it, resting his fingers on its keys.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe song is \u2018You Raise Me Up by Josh Groban,\u2019\u201d Ellis said. \u201cAt the very end of the song, it kind of fades and then there\u2019s this really big key change. Here I\u2019m thinking, we need to have a kind of goosebump moment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s when the rest of the concert choir rose to their feet, finishing the student-led performance. Students then presented her with a signed poster that read, \u201cWe love you Mrs. Brown,\u201d a basket filled with fruit and homemade goods, and a check for $400&#8211;all provided by choir students and their families in response to the passing of Brown\u2019s mother.<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Aug. 13, the second day of school, Brown received the news that her mother passed in an RV accident in Montana.<\/p>\n<p>She then took a few days off.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone knew that they couldn\u2019t just sit around and wait for her to be back,\u201d Montanez said. \u201cThey all wanted to do something. So many students came up to me shouting things they wanted to do for her, telling me that they just want to give her something that will express the thanks for all she\u2019s done, and no matter what, they\u2019re a family she can lean on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Students began planning a surprise for Brown to show their support.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Blake and I decided to do the fundraiser, we needed backup,\u201d Montanez said. \u201cWe talked to Alvarez and he gave us passes to go to each choir class for as long as we needed for about two weeks. So before my warmups we would talk to the class and start the donation process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the fundraiser, the choir decided to prepare a song for Brown\u2019s return.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cObviously we\u2019re in choir. We needed to sing her a song,\u201d Ellis said. \u00a0\u201cSo through that weekend before she came back, I organized a song. I figured out the piano parts because I can\u2019t read music. \u00a0First I taught it to Madrigals, which was really hard to do because I\u2019ve never taught before. \u00a0Through this I learned that she does so much you don\u2019t even acknowledge what she\u2019s doing. She does so much and makes it look easy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After arranging a song, signing posters, and collecting donations, the 6th hour class presented Brown with her gift on Thursday, Aug. 21.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt all came together beautifully,\u201d junior Madison Hofer-Holdeman said. \u201cWe had so many people crying, not just Mrs. Brown.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brown knows what she will do with the $400 she received.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHalf of it will go to the Livingston Stafford Animal Shelter who cared for my mom\u2019s five dogs, who were also in the accident but uninjured, until we were able to take them home,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe other half will go to the Yellowstone Wildlife Sanctuary in Red Lodge, Montana, a refuge for wild animals that cannot live in the wild. \u00a0It is a wonderful small zoo that my mother served as a volunteer at, planting and donating to support it. \u00a0They will be putting up a memorial bench in my mom\u2019s honor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brown\u2019s generosity and compassion inspired the choir students.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe was the reason for the response she got,\u201d Hofer-Holdeman said. \u201cWe all love her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Brown thinks her students deserve the credit.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have some really special students who are willing to put someone else before themselves,\u201d Brown said. \u201cPeople always tend to cast teenagers under a negative light. Yet, here are my choir students wanting to do something completely beyond themselves. You know, you never think something good could come out of an event like this. But it did.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Emotionally and physically exhausted, choir instructor Amy Brown returned to school.
