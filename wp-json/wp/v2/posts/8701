I don\u2019t disagree with that, but that\u2019s not why we don\u2019t allow hats and hoodies. I want to emphasize that it&#8217;s okay.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Do you think that all schools should have this no hats and hoods policy?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I find it difficult to tell other schools what they should do.

If you ever find me outside of here you\u2019ll find me in a hat.

So I do believe that all schools should adopt the same of not having hats. Not when you\u2019re leaving or you know, a baseball practice or whatever, but just not during the school day.<\/p>\n<p>*****<\/p>\n<p><b>Please say your name and what grade you\u2019re in.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>My name is Casey Helms.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Do you think that Northwest should allow their students to wear hoods and hats?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t mind hats.

It\u2019s so unfair if they\u2019re doing it and we\u2019re not.<\/p>\n<p>****<\/p>\n<p><b>Please say your name and what you teach.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>My name is Jason Cotter, and I teach Social Studies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Do you think it should be a universal rule, yes or no. Or should it be individual schools to decide for themselves?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>I think policies should ideally be district-wide. Because there\u2019s a district policy against cell phones now, and it makes it easier for teachers or admin to justify that, because it&#8217;s not just our school doing that. This is something that the board of education has decided, And we agree with it and we support it here at Northwest, but if it&#8217;s just school to school then it does create conflict because a lot of friends may have somebody at West or North or a different school and they could, use that as an argument against you , \u201clike why are they allowed at such and such school but not allowed to do it here?&#8221; And so I think it should be a policy one way or another all across the board, But I support the policy. So all right, Thank you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What is your personal opinion on the no hats or hoods rule here at Northwest?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Well, I, I support it because I think that students for one use their hoods and hats to hide their ear buds, which makes it easier for them to tune out the world, but also that they tend to use it to hide themselves too. Also, there\u2019s a certain amount of professionalism we want in our classrooms. I don\u2019t wear a hood or hat. And I don\u2019t listen to music when I teach or play on my cell phone when I teach. And we want a professional environment and if you went to a restaurant and you were being served by someone, I bet that server wouldn\u2019t have a hoodie up, right? We just want a sense of professionalism in our classroom, okay?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Could you please state your name? I\u2019m Mr. Holderman.
