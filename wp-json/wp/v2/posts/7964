He is persistent when it comes to keeping his grades up and making sure he has time in his schedule to keep up with his passions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rangel explains that he doesn&#8217;t stand out in a crowd although recently he dyed his hair pink which is contrasting to his statement in which he felt that he normally doesn\u2019t stand out. Rangel has a passion for painting and other forms of art. He picked up this passion from gaining lots of free time after his mom would not let him go outsideWeekends are filled with drawing, painting, and sewing time. Those are activities that keep him relaxed and mellowed out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt just became something I always loved to do and I&#8217;m still learning new ways to draw forms and shade along with finding different mediums to paint with,\u201d Rangel said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sewing is something he picked up not too long ago and it\u2019s something that he isn\u2019t the best at but is something that he feels passionate about. Rangel plans to continue learning new patterns and stitches. Learning how to find a steadying pattern and making himself a shirt that doesn\u2019t fall apart at the seams is a goal he has. Activities, passions, and goals are things that keep Rangel going to help motivate him.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy parents have always been impressed by my finished projects and think I can really make something out of them, they always take me out when they can if I&#8217;m in need of more supplies. \u201d Rangel said.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7966\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7966\" style=\"width: 267px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4529.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-7966\" src=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4529-267x475.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4529-267x475.jpg 267w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4529-507x900.jpg 507w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4529-768x1364.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4529-300x533.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4529.jpg 845w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7966\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jay Rangel holding some of the things that bring him joy<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7965\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7965\" style=\"width: 356px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4530.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-7965\" src=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4530-356x475.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"356\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4530-356x475.jpg 356w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4530-675x900.jpg 675w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4530-768x1025.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4530-300x400.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.northwestexplorer.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/IMG_4530.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7965\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jay Rangel&#8217;s items that bring him joy<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jay Rangel, a 17-year old Juinor from Northwest high school whose weekdays are filled with school homework, working on projects, and completing them before the deadlines hit.
