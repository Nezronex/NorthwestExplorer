Some students are not aware of the effect their online presence can have on their college plans. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students\u2019 social media outputs can influence admission counselors or coaches to decline or revoke a scholarship because of what students \u00a0post on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook. According to Kaplan Test Prep\u2019s 2013 Survey, 30 percent of college admissions officers found something online about an applicant that negatively affected their application. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why college career coordinator Danea Cramer cautions against posting questionable material.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you&#8217;re saying you are one thing on an application and then on social media you&#8217;re being inappropriate,\u201d Cramer said \u201c[colleges] probably won\u2019t give that money to you because you&#8217;re not putting yourself in a very good light,\u201d college career coordinator Danea Cramer said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Northwest, head basketball coach Bryan Chadwick has a Twitter for the basketball team where coaches could have access to a player\u2019s social media account. They will soon have an Instagram.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe are just being smart, being proactive because you don&#8217;t want that stuff to catch up with you,\u201d Chadwick said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For head football coach Steve Martin, reviewing a student&#8217;s account can occur when someone brings attention the the issue.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThose people and myself are looking at their profiles. I have had a parent or another teacher that follows a kid and says \u2018hey coach, you might wanna look what this guy has on his profile\u2019,\u201d Martin said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been parents that have brought attention to what their child or other student&#8217;s post. Online material considered inappropriate can range from violent to offensive posts or in relation of abusing drugs or alcohol. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have a strict drug policy here at Northwest when it comes to athletics,\u201d Martin said. \u201cMaybe they might not be a drug user or some of their friends might be, one of the big things is that they tie themselves into it just to try to be cool.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These actions affect everyone in other colleges around the U.S also.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI have seen it on ESPN \u00a0where college coaches have taken away scholarships. There was a kid out of Michigan. There was a kid out of Arkansas.They don\u2019t want character issues,\u201d Chadwick said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chadwick\u2019s assertion is true. In 2012, football player Yuri Wright was expelled from Don Bosco Prep high School in Ramsey, N.J.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because of racial and sexually graphic Twitter posts. He also lost \u00a0his scholarship to Michigan University.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Putting a thought or feeling out there for everyone to see can lead to huge consequences. Junior Samantha Gould has found this out the hard way where she would soon learn to think about posting every thought or feeling on the internet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt would turn into a huge mess, Gould said. \u201cI drifted away from a lot of people.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General admission for colleges sometimes do not look into students social media accounts.They just look to see if that student meets criteria, but if they are applying for a private college or a scholarship, they can choose to look up that student to see what they are posting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cScholarship money is a gift,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cIt&#8217;s nothing you have to pay back. So that can be anywhere from $250 to $2000 or more.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martin warns against risking this gift for likes or retweets, because mistakes online can be irreversible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Internet is a dictionary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt&#8217;s an encyclopedia of your past.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Prepping for college applications or making the dream sports team may be the next step for some after high school.
