Heath Ledger. Whitney Houston. Robin Williams. At least one of these names will register in your mind, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if they all did. The four listed above have made their marks on the world, but their fame isn\u2019t the only similarity that runs between them.<\/p>\n<p>With the recent death of Robin Williams, the topic of depression has been discussed by word of mouth, school assignments, and on the news. The death of the beloved actor came as a shock, many people not even aware that the man, who was seen by friends, co-stars, and fans as one of the happiest people on earth, had depression.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s a common theme with depression, typically depressed people are depicted as being bed-ridden and incapable of functioning, but in reality people can smile, function, and seem as if they\u2019re going about day-to-day life without a hitch. According to Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA), experts estimate that 5% of all teenagers will suffer from depression. Unfortunately, only 20% of depressed teens are appropriately diagnosed and treated. Meaning that of our estimated 1,400 adolescents, 70 of our students will be diagnosed with depression, and 14 of them will go untreated. That\u2019s merely in our school alone.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s very important for students in various situations to understand that they are not alone, but even more so when they\u2019re finding themselves feeling depressed. Remember that you\u2019re important, that people care about you, and you can reach out and look for the help you need. It isn\u2019t your job to pretend to be happy, but rather find the resources to help make yourself happy.<\/p>\n<p>As students of Northwest, we should take our Pride, Excellence, and Respect to the next step and try to understand that depression is a disease. It\u2019s not someone having a bad day, it isn\u2019t someone upset because of \u201csomething small\u201d, and it most definitely isn\u2019t something they\u2019re merely whining about and need to \u201cget over it\u201d. &nbsp;It\u2019s real, it\u2019s harmful, and it can hurt them on multiple levels. Offer a shoulder for them to lean on, an ear for them to talk to, or a place for them to go when they think they have no where else. Because sometimes, a person them up when they\u2019re down is all they need to start seeking the help they need.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel depressed, helpless, upset, or just as if the world is against you at any point and time, there are several resources you can use to your advantage. First and foremost, talk to someone you trust; a parent, guardian, counselor, teacher, or friend, they all have resources and care about you, they\u2019ll want to help. There is also several websites that allow you to seek the advice and words of people from all over the world such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/thequietplaceproject.com\/\">http:\/\/thequietplaceproject.com\/<\/a>, which is a site that has various tools to help you vent and release any negative thoughts or emotions.

Simply dial &nbsp;1-800-273-TALK (8255) to be connected to an operator who will listen to your current situation and help to the best of their abilities.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, Grizzlies that this is a disease, not a choice, and you must attempt to respect, understand, and help those around you, and that seek your help.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That way, you are never alone. <\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kurt Cobain.
