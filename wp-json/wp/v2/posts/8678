This year the student population has seen a huge shift in rules with two sticking out the most. Firstly ID\u2019s are mandatory, and secondly all use of cell phones during class has been prohibited. Leading to a general level of turbulence in the classroom with students and teachers often butting heads over the new policy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with this several students believe that the new restrictions on phones can negatively impact their education, as Channing Aiken a senior puts it, \u201cSimply teachers used cell phones for educational uses, whether it be for games like Kahoot, or things like if a website is blocked.\u201d This creates an interesting point that phones do have a level of educational use, one that can\u2019t easily be replaced by the heavily restricted laptops that students receive at the beginning of the year.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, even some students can admit how distracting they can be and how bad it can throw off their work. As Johnny Huynh a junior puts it, \u201cI think I used my cell phone in like all my classes\u2026 I couldn\u2019t get any work done.\u201d This shows that at least even a few students can recognize the harmful potential cell phones can have on education.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the new students, many of whom weren\u2019t able to use cell phones previously in middle school, many of them aren\u2019t super passionate. Casey Helms a freshmen states, \u201cI was kinda excited to have phones, but at the end of the day it isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d Overall this best represents how students have varying thoughts on the new rule, and the change it will have on the classroom environment both positive and negative.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a new year of school starts, new rules are often introduced.
