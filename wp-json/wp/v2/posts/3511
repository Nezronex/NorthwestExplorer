They know I\u2019m around and if they need anything I\u2019m here, and likewise, I can find them a lot easier.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Last season was Lambert\u2019s first year coaching at Northwest, and he didn\u2019t disappoint. He led the team to the state championship, where they took fourth out of 32 teams.<br \/>\nThe team is eager for March 2, when tryouts begin, but they know they\u2019re going to face some challenges.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis year, led by the senior group of players that I\u2019ve got, our expectation is to go back there and win a state title,\u201d said Lambert. \u201cBut first we know that we have to take care of things before that, like winning the city league and then winning regionals to get us to that point. So we\u2019re really excited about this year.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This year, Chris Lambert took on his first year teaching at Northwest while balancing his second year coaching the Northwest baseball team.
