In no way can oppressive people be oppressed. They hold no political\/social power because these are held by oppressors. They\u2019re being called out on their behavior and they can\u2019t take it.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the words of this online commenter on this article: \u201cChristians especially need special protection under the law now. They are being threatened with prison and bankruptcy for not supporting homosexual events when ordered to do so by homosexuals. Time to put Christians under civil rights protection,\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So somehow not being legally protected to harass someone is now a punishable offence in their eyes.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The threat of bankruptcy comes from the \u2018Christian\u2019 business owner\u2019s own problems with people, not the other way around.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I don\u2019t understand how the queer identity of someone else could have such a negative effect on someone that they feel the need to legally take away their feeling of security in places of business.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People claim that they do this in the name of their religion, but in reality, they\u2019re just being selfish.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Following in the footsteps of Kansas and Arizona, Mississippi now plans to legalize discrimination.
