They got spirit, how \u2018bout you? If you\u2019ve ever wanted to be one of those girls who wear the blue and gold pleated skirts, huge bows in their hair, and perform at every pep assembly, you\u2019re in luck because tryouts are just around the corner.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBefore tryouts there are three informational meetings, and you have to attend at least one of those meetings to make the team,\u201d cheerleading coach Tiffany Houle said.<\/p>\n<p>In order to make the team, there are a couple of school related requirements. First, you have to have a 2.5 GPA and you can\u2019t have an F in any core classes. Other requirements are you must be able to accomplish a toe-touch and one other jump of your choice. The last thing that is misunderstood according to Houle is that cheerleading is a year-round commitment.<\/p>\n<p>The pricing for a first time cheerleader is 750 dollars however, if you are a returning cheerleader the pricing is 520 dollars. The cheerleaders do many fundraisers, and the profits made by the fundraisers take out what is owed from the 750\/520 dollars.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[The cost] is a little bit expensive, personally it\u2019s not expensive for my family but for others it is,\u201d freshman Breanne Hardiman said.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of cheerleading wouldn\u2019t be so high if the school would actually fund the sport.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should get more funding from the school\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 because we are at every game, no matter how the weather is, so we deserve it,\u201d sophomore Karlee Cooper said.<\/p>\n<p>Since cheerleading is a year round commitment, including practicing in the summer, the cheerleaders get to know each other extremely well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe spend so much time practicing together, and cheering at games we become a family. We all become close and before the year is over we are inseparable,\u201d sophomore Taryn Niedens said.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore the cheerleaders are more than just the people trying to pump the basketball and football teams up at games, they are a \u2018family.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>They got spirit, yes they do!
