In this competition, participants could choose to partake in a mock student congress or in a script of their choosing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stakes are high in this competition, as only two students per district in each event can go to Nationals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt can be really hard there are a lot of really strong speakers, like the people who get presidential scholarships,\u201d Maize South competitor Jessica Tongue said. \u201cThis is also one of the things where you can go to state or nationals, but if you want to go to nationals it\u2019s very hard.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forensics is a semester class at Northwest. It is a mixture of debate, drama, and speech where a student can choose to learn about all three skills or just one. Senior Whitney Clum,who helped host the competition Tuesday, \u00a0sees forensics as a skill that has helped her organize her thoughts and become a better public speaker. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSome people do sports every week, some people do choir practice; I do forensics and debate,\u201d Clum said. \u201cIt&#8217;s something that I do every single weekend. I go home [and] I practice. It\u2019s just like any other thing; you&#8217;re only as good as you really want to be and how much you practice.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forensics also teaches students how to appeal to different kinds of people and how to become more persuasive. Said skills may be an advantage when it comes to a college or job interview. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou can just come across as very well spoken no matter who or what it is,\u201d Clum said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all the infamous Kansas education budget cuts, Forensics may be the next target. Tongue stated that she believes Maize is not planning on eliminating forensics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA lot of schools are cutting it, but hopefully those schools will still offer it as an afterschool activity because it&#8217;s important,\u201d Tongue said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forensics tournaments are unique in the sense that competitors are independent in their performances, which causes a more difficult yet friendly competition. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[There\u2019s] such a friendly attitude,\u201d Clum said. \u201cWith Northwest it\u2019s even better because our old coach is married to the Curtis High coach. For a while there we would take car trips together and we still had a pretty close relationship. But the majority of the people in forensics are really nice people.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Forensics is often compared to debate due to the overlapping of teams, but they are separate competitions with significant differences. Clum compares the two to Obama and Putin shaking hands.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey were like \u2018We\u2019re shaking hands\u2019 and at the same time they\u2019re like, \u2018I&#8217;m going to kill you.\u2019\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The atmosphere and efforts made by the participants of the two competitions are also different.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDebate is so intense and you\u2019re face to face arguing,\u201d Clum said. \u201cIn forensics you\u2019re not even seeing the person you\u2019re competing against. There&#8217;s nothing you can do other than your own individual performance to outdo anyone else.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many area high schools came to Northwest to participate in a forensics competition on March 29.
