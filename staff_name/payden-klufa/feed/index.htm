										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In the Northwest library, students were allowed to donate canned goods to pay for their library fines. Librarians Rinann Speaker and Kim Isherwood decided to start the donation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We figured since there was so much going on in December with donations and people are donated out between Thanksgiving and Christmas that we would wait and do it in February around Valentines Day.” Speaker said</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many students donated food to pay for library fines anywhere from $3 to $25.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We want our books back. We want people to read them and to bring them back. It’s nice to get fines, to buy more books. But really we want our materials back.” Speaker said</p>
<p dir="ltr">The canned goods were donated to the Kansas Food Bank. One item could be worth up to $3. Some students brought in a lot of cans to pay for expensive fines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When we sent out notices for late books. There were 600 notices.” Speaker Said</p>
<p>Students were allowed to bring in canned good the week before spring break began. Many students brought in canned goods and returned their late books. After donating all the canned goods, and getting their materials back, the librarians were happy to check out books to students that couldn’t because of their fines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">On Feb. 15 sophomores Chris Kliewer, Marie Altgilbers, and Emily Dulohery and seniors Josue Quintana, Taryn Powers, and Kylie Norton competed in the state Scholars Bowl tournament. Out of 8 teams the Northwest team came in last. However, this is the first time in at least 11 years that Northwest has qualified for state. It doesn’t take much to be a part of Scholars Bowl.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Scholars Bowl is a team of academically talented students, and we go to tournaments, and we answer questions about lots of topics,” said Dulohery.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anyone is welcome to join Scholars Bowl; there are no tryouts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It takes a lot of practice to make it to state. The questions are harder, and it’s a difficult challenge for the Northwest team. The Northwest team practiced once a week, and ate lots of pizza. Although the team was disappointed in the results, they were happy they made it, and enjoyed the day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Theatre Review- Payden Klufa</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Feb. 20, 21, and 22, the Wichita Northwest Drama program performed the play Fools written by Neil Simon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The play was about a young Russian teacher, Leon Tolchinsky, that scored a job in a small village. When he arrives he finds out that all the citizens of the village have been cursed with Chronic Stupidity for 200 years. Confused and frustrated, just as he was giving up on teaching the citizens, he falls hopelessly in love with a stupid girl, who recently just learned how to sit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tolchinsky was played by Junior Joshua Peavey, and the stupid girl was played by Senior Paige Lundin. The two actors did a wonderful job playing their parts, and end the play without a dull moment. Peavey and Lundin had great on stage chemistry, and the rest of the crew did a wonderful job making the play worth watching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The play followed a dinner, and included a short 15 minute intermission, including dessert you could buy before you watched the second half. Richard Lundin, the director, did an amazing job putting together a wonderful, funny show that left the audience craving more.</p>
