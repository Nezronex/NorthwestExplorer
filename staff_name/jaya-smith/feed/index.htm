										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people have a celebrity/tik tok idol. An idol is a person you look up to(most likely a famous/popular person).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freshman Elayne Logan looks up to 40 year old musician, tiktoker, and author Hank Green. Hank Green talks about science and answers a lot of science questions on his tiktok. Logan said she looks up to Green because of who he is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look up to Hank Green. Why? ‘Cause he&#8217;s a scientist. He knows so much, answers all my sciency science question and he’s just Bill Nye on TikTok,” Logan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also said Green makes things enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ I mean he’s really funny and puts science in a way that’s enjoyable. He asks the questions that are useless but fun to know,” Logan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Junior Rylee Lopez looks up to 40 year old model, producer, and actress Kim Kardashian. Kim Kardashian is married to Kayne West and has a reality TV show called Keeping up with the Kardashian’s. Lopez said she looks up to Kardashian because of her social activism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She has fought for criminal justice reform and has helped Cynthia Brown gain freedom after being unfairly sentenced to life without parole.” Lopez said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also said Kardashian is a great mother and is also really funny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ I think she is a great mother and a great wife despite all the craziness she has had to deal with. I used to watch ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians’ and I just found Kim funny.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaylee Bates looks up to 27 year old singer-songwriter and talent show judge Maghan Trainor. Trainor is a singer who blew up with her song “All about that Bass”. Bates said she looks up to Trainor because she speaks on body positivity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A celebrity that I look up to is Meghan Trainor because she isn’t bothered about what people think of her and she is proud of her body. She doesn’t try to change herself for others,” Bates said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bates also said she likes her music because it is so positive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her music makes me happy because it tells people that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their body and that they are perfect the way they are without trying,” Bates said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People look up to others for different reasons and they keep them happy. Singer Ariana Grande says it best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Never hate on someone’s idol, they can be the only reason they are still alive.”&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to Covid-19 people are required to wear mask in a public place. There are still people who refuse to wear a mask in the store. It’s a requirement but every once and a while you&#8217;ll see people without a mask. Do they have a point to not wear one? What should happen to them? Is there other things mask can do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a requirement to wear masks in public whether someone’s at a gas station, the store, or a restaurant. Mask may not make a person immune to Covid-19 but it helps lower the risk of them getting it. It helps keep people safe and healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people who don’t wear mask when they are supposed to I feel like there should be proper action taken. I feel if someone doesn’t wear a mask in a public place, anyone who works there should ask them calmly to wear a mask or leave. If they refuse to leave they should be denied service. Now if someone starts causing a huge scene the worker should just leave them alone to stop any possible physical confrontation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who don’t wear mask should really look at the unnecessary trouble they are causing. For the thirty minuets of wearing a mask in a store isn’t bad if its helping keep people safe from the pandemic. Wearing a mask is not only helping you but others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask can do more than help keep you safe from a pandemic. Mask can help keep your face warm in the winter. Little kids who have allergies don’t quite understand how important it is to sneeze in your arm or tissue. So wearing a mask can help block that sneeze. Wearing a mask can help in so many different ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask is important and if people refuse to there should be proper precautions taken.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Altgilbers is a freshman at Northwest high school who enjoys academics. He enjoys academics&nbsp; like history, drama, reading, and even studying things like military and politics. He has his thoughts on Trump, music, and movies like everyone else.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers listens country music and likes it over other music. He has a disliking for modern music. Altgilbers states modern music is artificial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Modern music just seems excessively artificial to me” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers likes to read, learn about history, do drama, study military on the weekends, and meatloaf. He enjoys drama because he enjoys putting on theater. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The class I am most interested in is drama because I very much enjoy putting on theatre,” Altigilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like everyone else, Altgilbers has his thoughts on politics and Trump himself. He thinks Trump isn’t good at what he does but has some good points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thoughts on Trump are that he&#8217;s really not good at anything he does, unless he&#8217;s creating chaos. He&#8217;s very good at that. Some more thoughts on Trump are that he was pretty competent as a businessman, but not as a president,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altgilbers is a fan of Star Trek and there is one movie he prefers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Star Trek VI is my favorite movie because it has my favorite things and tells a great story with them: sci-fi, diplomacy, and rogue generals.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covid-19 cases are on the rise once again. Things that people need to fulfill their basic needs are flying off the shelves. People are starting stock up in fear of another shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limits are slowly starting to be put into to the works. Limits are starting to be put on toilet paper and paper towels where you can only buy one of each. Things like beef, pork, and chicken are starting to have limits as well. Slowly soda is starting to get limits at Dillon&#8217;s and Sam&#8217;s.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toilet paper is flying off the shelves like it did earlier in the year. Stores like Walmart, Dillon&#8217;s, and Costco are stocked with plenty of toilet paper in variety of brands. Sam&#8217;s on the other hand are struggling to keep toilet paper on the shelves. Once toilet paper is put on the shelves it’s gone within minuets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canned food like beans, fruits, vegetables, and soup are almost impossible to find on a daily basis. Throughout the week it gets harder to find can food. It’s better to go get canned food on days a store stocks so you have a better selection before things start to disappear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not soda is getting harder to find during the pandemic. Popular brands like Pepsi, Coke, and Sprite are getting harder to find at stores like Costco and Sam&#8217;s. Stores like Walmart and Dillon&#8217;s are stocked on the popular brands but non popular brands like lemonade are almost impossible to get your hands on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of materials to fulfill basic needs are one of the many problems that Covid-19 has caused.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 has been different and not what everyone had planned. There is one thing right now that people are debating over and that is Trick or treating. Should kids go? Should kids stay home? What are some other options? Everyone has their own opinions on these questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to COVID-19 we have to take proper precautions to stay safe like social distancing, wearing mask, constantly using hand sanitizer, and staying inside. These things we have to do to stay safe is messing with Trick or Treating. It isn’t possible to Trick or treat and do what its necessary to stay safe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angie Rodriguez-Guzman, a freshman, has her opinions on why kids shouldn&#8217;t trick or treat this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I personally do not think kids should trick or treat this Halloween. Though candy is in packages it&#8217;s still unsafe because the outside of those packages is still being touched by the person giving out. Kids are going door to door breathing in air that isn&#8217;t safe,” Guzman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Altgilbers is another freshman at Northwest who has opinions on Trick or treating in 2020. He believes that it’s not safe and kids should stay indoors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do not think that kids should trick or treat this year. It&#8217;s definitely not safe, children are irresponsible and don&#8217;t wear masks willingly,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While trick or treating isn’t safe parents will still go to let their kids have some fun since 2020 has been a rough year. Guzman said that even though trick or treating isn’t safe there are a few things parents could do to make it a little safer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they do trick or treat, always wear a mask even under your own if you have a mask costume. Best to wear gloves, and before stepping into the house either leave the costume outside or spray disinfectant spray on it before stepping into your home for everyone&#8217;s safety. I also think spraying the candy wrappers with disinfectant before touching them is a good idea,” Guzman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The safest thing to do on Halloween this year is to stay indoors. Guzman and Altgilbers both have a few alternate options to do instead of trick or treating. Guzman said you could trick or treat in the house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ Dressing up is still always an option but staying home is the safest. You can do a trick or treat in your own home, decorate it for spooky season, bring your family together, and trick or treat from room to room,” Guzman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Halloween will be different this year it will definitely be something for the books. Halloween will be celebrated differently but memories will be made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As for what parents could do to keep it safe, just keep the kiddos in and buy them some candy. Instead of going out, they could stay in and watch a movie,” Altgilbers said.</span></p>
