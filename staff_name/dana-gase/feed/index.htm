										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanksgiving day 2013, who knew that would be the last holiday i&#8217;d ever get to spend with you who knew after we said goodnight that would be the last hug, kiss, and I love you i&#8217;d get to share with you. I didn&#8217;t. Christmas morning I was awoken by my mom crying telling me to call my dad. Within the first five minutes of my christmas, one of the most joyful holidays I received quite possibly the worst news of my life. Great grandma died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The next day my dad, sister and I climbed into the car and made the 14 hour drive we all knew too well. When we finally arrived to Ohio my family was waiting with warm loving arms and shoulders to cry on. December 31st, just like any other day we got up, ate breakfast and got ready. But it wasn&#8217;t just another day, it was the day to say goodbye to the most lovable selfless women ever known. Later that night we all gathered back at grandmas to be together. While the adults were upstairs playing cards, drinking and watching the Ohio state game, the children were in the basement doing what we thought adults did (minus the drinking(;). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 11:30 p.m. we all got on our coats, grabbed a drink and walked the two minutes to say one final goodbye. As we were counting the minutes to starting a new year we shared our favorite stories and memories. When I think of love and warmth, this is what comes to mind. Although it was nearly 10 degrees and I lost the biggest role model this is it. The world is a cruel evil place that takes things away from us when we are not ready to say goodbye. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here&#8217;s my advice to you, just something you can learn from this, take every holiday, celebration and every moment in between and cherish them, because you never know when your I love you will be the last. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the girls and boys basketball teams, there was a combined total of ten wins during the 2014-2015 season. Boys varsity coach Bryan Chadwick and girls coach Deitric Sanders are determined to not let history repeat itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanders plans on achieving this goal by using the experience of his team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just see us getting a little bit more experienced,” Sanders said. “We had a lot of youth last year and a lot of injuries so I&#8217;m just hoping that youth gets more experience and improves this year. Hopefully, they all continue to grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chadwick plans on relying on new faces for an energy boost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a lot of new guys playing with us, a lot of new talent,” Chadwick said. “We’re hoping to gain some chemistry with them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chadwick also aims to gain support from the student body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last year we had a lot of people come and support us,” Chadwick said. “We just want to give them the results they came for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chadwick hopes to change the energy of the team by getting more students to attend the games and cheer them on, whether they’re winning or losing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We feed off of it,” Chadwick said. “They play better, they play harder and that is something they need to see, they need to see their fans out there for them. It makes everyone play harder, it even makes me coach harder.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both teams opened the season with a win against West on Friday, Dec. 4. The boys won 71-60 and the girls won 68-36. The girls will face Bishop Carroll at home on Tuesday, Dec. 8 at 6 p.m., followed by the boys at 7:30 p.m.                  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its a game of chance, the odds of being diagnosed with Thyroid cancer is 1 in 97 people.  Sophomore Breanna Wespi is one of those 97. During an appointment with her doctor it was brought to her attention that there were possible cancer cells in her thyroid.</p>
<p>“It was kind of surprising to me because of what I went to the doctor for,” Wespi said.“It wasn&#8217;t painful or anything, I didn&#8217;t feel anything, so when they said it, it was really out of the blue and random.” </p>
<p>The thyroid is in the shape of a butterfly and sits right above the larynx at the front of the throat. It affects your metabolism, growth and hormones so the medicine would regulate the metabolism.  </p>
<p>After four different tests and a biopsy, her doctors decided they needed to remove the left side of her thyroid. On Thursday, Feb. 12 Wespi will undergo surgery, while she is in surgery her doctors will conduct more tests, looking for any other possible cancer cells. If they find more cells on the right side of her thyroid they will go back and remove the rest of it. </p>
<p>Surgery always has some sort of risk for Thyroid surgery Wespi could suffer from permanent damage to her vocal cords if they are nicked.  </p>
<p>“&#8230;the only thing that could change if they did take out all of my thyroid would be I’d have to be on medicine for the remainder of my life. So really I’ll just have to take a pill a day,” Wespi said.  </p>
<p>Wespi said that if the test come back positive with more cancer cells then she will have to stay at an overnight hospital where they would give her a radioactive pill which will get rid of any other possible cancer cells. </p>
<p>One Week Later </p>
<p>“I just couldn&#8217;t believe that they actually found cancer, it was the last thing I would of expected.”  Wespi said.  After waking up loopy and disoriented Wespi asked the one question that shes been wondering the answer to for weeks. “Do I have cancer?”  </p>
<p>When the doctors were doing the test on her while she was under they unfortunately found more cancer cells in the other half of her thyroid. After they removed the whole thyroid they stunded a lobe that is in your body which produces calcium. Wespi is currently taking medicine to make calcium in her body, her thyroid pill which will help her metabolism, and pain medicine to help the pain. </p>
<p>“I am really thankful that i&#8217;m going to be okay now and the cancer is gone since we caught it pretty quick,” Wespi said. “but hopefully I’ll do the radiation soon and it will kill any other cancer cells.” </p>
<p>In about a month or two Wespi will start the radiation treatment to eliminate all remaining cancer cells. She is going to take the radioactive pill then spend 24 hours in a hospital. For about a week after she is released she will be “isolated” because she will be radioactive so she will need to keep a 5 foot radius around her.</p>
<p>“I mean it really could&#8217;ve been bad, if I wouldn&#8217;t of gone to the doctor that day it could of spread and I might not have been so lucky.” Wespi said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day of 21-year-old Kaleb Bonilla’s funeral, Northwest students wore blue to show their support for junior Rosemary Bonilla. </p>
<p>The idea was brought on by junior Chelsee Cushenbery who then proceeded to organize the whole event. Cushenbery asked concert choir to help out by recording the group singing “We Lift You Up”, and sending it to Bonilla hoping to lift her spirits. </p>
<p>“It was after the funeral I had looked at my phone and saw the notification,” Bonilla said, “I was like, ‘Wow, they did that for me.’ I was just like, ‘dang that makes me feel good.’”</p>
<p>On Jan. 17, Bonilla unexpectedly lost her brother, Kaleb. Coming back to school she expected to be overwhelmed by her peers after the incident, but she realized she had more supporters than she ever thought. </p>
<p>“It just made me feel really good that it helped her, and her knowing that there are people out there that still care and are here supporting her,” Cushenbery said.</p>
<p>News spread fast with the help of Twitter and Instagram. It mostly started out with juniors, but then everyone began tweeting #Blue4Rose, telling everyone to wear blue in honor of Kaleb. </p>
<p>“We all love Rose. She’s been there for so many people, so I just wanted to try to be there for her,” Cushenbery said. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Mamba, jina langu ni Ilphan.” That’s one of the many ways freshman Ilphan Nkrumbia can introduce himself. It translates to “Hello, my name is Ilphan.”</p>
<p>He grew up in Dar es salaam, Tanzania&#8211;the eastern part of Africa near the Indian Ocean. Nkrumbia can speak up to 5 different languages including English, French, Swahili, Turkish, and Arabic. He learned French, Swahili, and Arabic while he was growing up. When he was a little older he began to learn Turkish, then progressively learned English as he started living here in the United States.</p>
<p>Before moving to the U.S., he lived with his grandparents and his mother Mariam. “ His father Sadiq moved before he was born so he never got the chance to connect with him. Sadiq got remarried to his stepmom Saada. Nkrumbia has two younger sisters Huilyat and Yusra who both live with him here in Kansas.</p>
<p>“I like to travel, to see other peoples cultures,” Nkrumbia said. He wants to visit China, Australia, Europe, and Asia. He likes to see how all the different cultures and people behave towards each other, he also enjoys trying new things.</p>
<p>When Nkrumbih turned 14, and finished primary (middle school) his dad said that he would move him out here to live with him. It was a difficult start to the year. He felt out of place and lacking in connections with his peers. Around the second week of school he started making friends and adjusting to the lifestyles of America and how different they are to the ones in Tanzania.</p>
<p><strong>“It is different, but I hate staying away from my mom,” Nkrumbih said.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a new advisor and meetings almost every day during 9th hour, Student Senate is making changes to increase Northwest school spirit and student participation.</p>
<p>“It will be 100 times better. We are already planning and making decisions that will involve everybody at Northwest. [We’re] really making Student Senate the best it can be,” Student Body President Anna Griekspoor said.</p>
<p>One big goal for Student Senate is to get the students more involved with the games and extracurricular programs at Northwest through the competition called Class of the Year (COTY).</p>
<p>COTY is a new program where at certain planned events held by the school will have Student Senate members taking tallies for each class. When you attend a game, concert, or assembly you check in with your class and earn points. At the end of the year all the points will be added and the class with the most will get an award that will be announced later in the year.</p>
<p>“It is a good idea because we don’t have that much school spirit unless it is at a football game,” junior representative Taylor Webber said.</p>
<p>Student Senate is also looking to get more involved in and outside of school while also working on organization.</p>
<p>“Instead of just the teacher and one president, pretty much everyone is getting involved and has a say in spirit week and homecoming,” sophomore treasurer Vanessa Cowdin said.</p>
<p>Student Senate has talked about doing some community service with the feeder patterns for Northwest, including Kensler, Peterson, McCollom and Wilbur.</p>
<p>“Maybe they will be more excited knowing the tradition,” advisor Sarah Gegen said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>September Events for COTY:</p>
<p>9/11 patriotic dress for United Way Week</p>
<p>9/12 Anything Goes assembly</p>
<p>9/16 volleyball</p>
<p>9/18 choir concert</p>
<p>9/24 Powderpuff</p>
<p>9/26 assembly</p>
<p>9/30 soccer</p>
