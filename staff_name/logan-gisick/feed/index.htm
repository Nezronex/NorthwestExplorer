										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that some people dream in black &amp; white while others dream in color? Did you know that the average person will spend six years of his life dreaming? Listen close, because I’m about to tell you something that is going to make all of your dreams come true (within your dreams).  Though our bodies may be lying motionless on our beds at night, our minds are running wild within our heads, randomly taking us on adventures to places both familiar and unfamiliar to us. We wake up the following morning with a brief memory of a really cool dream, but we quickly plant our feet firmly on the ground and continue our regular lives. Usually, by the time we lay down for bed that night, the magical memory of our last dream is gone as if it never happened.</p>
<p>Before I go into the possibilities that have always been open to you, I want to discuss the nature of the mind. Our brain may be the last things humans still have left to explore simply because we know so little about them. It has been said that we only use 10 percent of our brain. We’ve gone to the moon, invented the hydrogen bomb, established a world wide web and built the pyramids at Giza (maybe). If we’ve done this much using only 10 percent of our brain, what could we do with 20 percent? 30 percent?  100 percent?</p>
<p>The human brain cycles through four different kinds of brain waves:  Alpha, Delta, Theta and Beta. Each type of brain wave represents a different speed of oscillating electrical voltages in the brain. Delta is the slowest and is present in deep sleep. Theta is present in stage one when we&#8217;re in light sleep. Alpha waves occur during REM sleep (as well as when we are awake). And beta waves are usually only seen in very stressful situations or situations that require very strong mental concentration and focus. To enter the fifth and final stage of the sleep cycle, the REM stage, we must be in a deep enough sleep for our brains to produce delta waves (1).</p>
<p>REM (rapid eye movement) sleep lasts from 5 to twenty minutes during the 90 minute sleep cycle and is accompanied by constant and sporadic eye movement. Once we enter REM sleep, several physiological changes take place. The heart rate and breathing quickens, the blood pressure rises, we can&#8217;t regulate our body temperature as well and our brain activity increases to the same level (alpha) as when we are awake, or even higher. The rest of the body, however, is essentially <strong>paralyzed</strong> until we leave REM sleep. This paralysis is caused by the release of glycine, an amino acid, from the brain stem onto the motoneurons (neurons that conduct impulses outward from the brain or spinal cord). Because REM sleep is the sleep stage at which most dreaming takes place, this paralysis could be nature&#8217;s way of making sure we don&#8217;t act out our dreams. Throughout the night, it’s possible to go through each of these five phases several times. However, each subsequent cycle, will include more REM sleep and less non-REM sleep (1).</p>
<p>Our brain registers things through chemicals and electric signals. During the REM stage of the sleep cycle, the electric signals in our brains are going crazy, all over the place. Scientists have hypothesized many different answers to the purpose of this activity, but only a few have stood the test time. Early civilizations believed that dreams were very real; tangible places that could only be accessed while asleep. More recent theories suggest that the signals in our brains are completely random, and dreams are the storylines that our brain attributes the signals in order to make sense of them when we wake up the next morning (3). Others believe that dreams are just our brain letting off steam, necessary for dealing with the stress in our daily lives. But the most interesting theory, I believe, is that dreams are actually a lot like our brains working overtime, solving problems we may have and providing us with fresh insight and creative inspiration (2). <em> </em></p>
<p>Understanding the science and theories of dreams is the first step to understanding how to recall them and eventually, control them. Though we sometimes wake in the morning with no recollection of our dream, it does not mean that a dream did not take place. In fact, we have multiple dreams every night. Dream <em>amnesia</em> is the norm. This is not due to anything paranormal or supernatural, but to weak encoding in short-term memory (5). Because our dreams are so random and the nature of the memory is so faint, we often forget our dreams partially or more often than not, completely. Also, though they are seeing so many images, people often do not remember their dreams, because the forward-thinking nature of humans makes this difficult. Most people could care less to dwell on their dream when they wake up in the morning, and quickly carry on with their day. The vague memory of dreams naturally leads us to believe that they are unimportant. We have a lot to gain however, from remembering and embracing our dreams as relevant.</p>
<p>Besides the recreational and self developing aspect of remembering and acknowledging your dreams, they may also contain much more useful information. The inventor of the sewing machine, Elias Howe, had struggled in 1884 to figure out how the needle could work in a machine for sewing. In a dream, he found himself surrounded by native tribesmen with spears that had a hole in the point. When he woke up, he realized that a needle with a hole in the point would solve his problem. Mary Shelly, author of &#8220;Frankenstein,&#8221; got the idea for the story from a dream. Edgar Allen Poe got inspiration from a dream featuring large luminous eyes for his story, &#8220;Lady Ligea.&#8221; Many musicians, including Paul McCartney, Billy Joel and Beethoven, have found inspiration for their music from their dreams. Some hear musical arrangements in their dreams, while others hear lyrics (1).</p>
<p>We’ve covered the science of dreaming, the theories behind dreams and the importance of dreaming; now for the fun part. It is estimated that fewer than 100,000 people in the United States have the ability to have lucid dreams (1). It requires thought, and a little bit of effort, but it can easily be achieved by anyone with a little bit of knowledge and willpower. This paper will provide the knowledge, you must provide the willpower. The first step is remembering your dreams. If you can remember your dreams, you can recognize whether they are lucid or not.</p>
<p>Starting off when you go to bed, tell yourself you will remember your dreams. This in itself and thinking about your dreams throughout the day will help you to better remember your dreams. It is said that five minutes after the end of a dream, we have forgotten 50 percent of the dream&#8217;s content. Ten minutes later, we&#8217;ve forgotten 90 percent of its content (4). I am one of many people who record their dream in a notebook as soon as I wake up in the morning. The reinforcement of that faint dream memory will bring the dream from your subconscious into your consciousness, and allow you to recall on the memory long after you wake up. Others find that an easier method is to stay in bed and create some associations. The easiest association is made by giving the dream a title and a purposive description. For example, a dream of being chased by a polar bear across the snow into a library might be labeled &#8220;Research the Polar Bear.&#8221; Go back to sleep and you are likely to remember the dream by recalling the title (5).</p>
<p>In 1989, <strong>Paul Tholey</strong>, a German dream researcher wrote a paper about a technique he was studying to induce lucid dreams. It was called the <strong>reflection technique</strong>, and it involved asking yourself throughout the day if you were awake or dreaming (1). If you get used to doing this while awake on a daily basis, you will begin doing this while you are asleep. If you were to see a vulture wearing a sombrero sitting in the passenger seat of your car in a dream and asked yourself, “Am I awake?” you would realize that you were dreaming, thus, achieving lucidity within a dream. Once aware that you are dreaming, you have the ability to take absolute control of your dream. It will definitely take a few tries, but you will soon notice how quickly you make progress both by remembering more and more of your dream and by having much more vivid and detailed dreams.  Lucid dreaming can be both fun and therapeutic, and the possibilities are only as limited as your imagination. So to all who are interested in achieving lucidity within a dream I tell you, goodnight and good luck.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the span of this school year, a few Distributive Education Clubs of America (DECA) members have been working very hard on a little project they call Hoops for Hearts. Despite some snow day postponements, the organizers still managed to raise $1,700 for the American Heart Association.</p>
<p>“It’s a DECA project that Uyen Tran, Julia Doan and I have been working on and all of the money we’ve helped raise goes straight to the American Heart Association,” junior DECA member Victoria Devereaux said.</p>
<p>They started out by selling paper hearts for a dollar each, from which they made a collage. Eventually they sold T-shirts, had a balloon release and even hosted a dance class for a Latin American dance called Zumba.</p>
<p>“In the end we raised $1,700 and we’re taking the written event to State,” Devereaux said. “If we win State, we’ll be going to Nationals in Orlando Florida.”</p>
<p>At the winter homecoming game, basketball players donned red shoe laces and during the halftime show, elementary school kids came in for some jump roping. Also, the game winning ball was delivered by junior Chelsea Smith, who has dealt with heart problems of her own, and a check was presented by Mel Hamilton Ford for $500.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What They Tell Us:</strong></p>
<p>As students, we are taught in history class that the pyramids in Egypt were built between 2700 B.C and 1500 B.C. The pyramids at Giza are known to be the most popular pyramids; thought to have been built around 2540 B.C. Though they hadn’t yet invented the wheel, apparently 20,000-30,000 laborers constructed the great pyramids at Giza in less than 23 years.</p>
<p>The pyramids at Giza are located on the west side of the Nile River in Cairo, Egypt and the site was said to have been chosen because the Egyptians believed that since the sun set in the west, the darkness symbolized death. They followed an ancient belief that the pharaoh’s soul would join with the sun disc as the sun set. First, the site was flooded and excess bedrock was removed to level the ground. It was then time to extract the massive amount of stone needed to construct such a monument. The inner core of the pyramid was made of local sandstone while the outer layer was made of finer quality sandstone brought in from elsewhere. Exactly how the Egyptians were able to extract and transport so much rock is still unknown.</p>
<p>Experts believe that copper chisels were used to cut sandstone and limestone but other rocks such as dolerite and granite would have required stronger materials. About 60-70 workers are said to have used massive dolerite pounders to pulverize the edges of the stone they were trying to extract. At the bottom of the stone they shoved wooden pegs into slots they had cut and filled the slots with water so that the pegs would expand and the stone would break away.</p>
<p>Because most of the stone resources were too far away to drag so many tons of granite, they used boats to carry them closer to the construction site. Each block on the pyramid weighed 2.5 tons on average with some stones weighing as much as 80 tons, and that is after stone masons sculpted it to the right size and shape. The pyramid consists of over 2.3 million stones.  There are two theories on how the stone was transported on land; one is that large logs were placed under the stone and workers pulled on ropes attached to it while a few men replaced the logs and a few pushed from behind. Another theory is that the team of men attached ropes to the stone and pulled it across a slipway lubricated by oil as one man continued to lubricate the slipway in front of the rock.</p>
<p>After the stone was cut and brought to the site of the pyramid, they had to place it. Since the pyramid is 487 feet high, the question arises how the Egyptians would place such heavy stones so perfectly, especially at such a great height.  Scientists believe they used ramps made of mud brick because if they were made of stone, there would be more stone needed to construct the ramps then would have been needed to construct the pyramid itself. So ramps made of mud brick were used and coated with chips of plaster to harden the surface.  As the pyramid grew, so did the ramps, growing both taller and wider around the pyramid.</p>
<p><strong>The Inconsistencies and Interesting Coincidences</strong>:</p>
<p>All of this information makes sense on the surface, but it’s when we begin to dig a little deeper that we start to question what history and modern science tells us to be true. For starters, as you can see in the pictures below, the pyramids at Giza correspond perfectly with the three stars that form Orion’s Belt. How is it that the ancient Egyptians were able to seemingly copy the exact size and position of these stars when telescopes were not even invented until a thousand years later?</p>
<p>Also, if the Egyptians were to use logs to move the giant stones, where did all the trees come from? Egypt has very few trees except date trees, which they would not want to cut down half a million of because dates were also one of their main sources of food.</p>
<p>Another startling piece of knowledge is that even though the ancient Egyptians were known for documenting almost everything, the tallest, greatest of the pyramids, The Great Pyramid is never mentioned. The pyramid was referred to a few times in very early Hieroglyphics where Egyptian writing suggests the Great Pyramid was standing before Egyptians populated the land.</p>
<p>If you take the perimeter of the Great Pyramid and divide it by two times the height, you get a number that is exactly equivalent to the number pi (3.14159&#8230;) up to the fifteenth digit. The number pi wasn’t even calculated to the fourth digit until the 6<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Strangely, though the sides of the base of the pyramid are some 757 feet long, it still forms an almost perfect square.  Every angle in the base is exactly 90 degrees and the pyramid is also less than a third of a degree off from facing the exact magnetic polar North while compasses were not yet invented. It’s interesting just how precise the pyramid is when you take into consideration that even the slightest difference could have thrown the whole pyramid off like the leaning Tower of Pisa, constructed in 1178. With technology over four thousand years more advanced than the ancient Egyptians, even the Italians’ measurements were off by three meters, causing the tower to lean at a 5.5 degree angle.</p>
<p>If you take the lines of longitude and latitude the pyramid lies on, thirty one degrees north by thirty one degrees west, they are the two lines that cover the most combined land area in the world. In essence, the pyramid is the center of all of the land mass of the whole earth.</p>
<p>Finally, the height of the pyramid is 481, which is almost exactly 1/1,000,000,000 of the distance from the earth to the sun (480.6 billion feet).</p>
<p><strong>The Theory:</strong></p>
<p>Ancient aliens built the sphinx and the pyramids at Giza around 10,500 B.C. Why would anyone believe such a load of crap? Though there is no solid proof, there are far too many inconsistencies for myself and many others to believe that the ancient Egyptians, with no compasses, with no telescopes, with no machinery, and with no historical records of ever building the some of the most famous pyramids, could have possible been the ones to build one of the Seven Wonders of the World. So who did?</p>
<p>Because there are signs of water erosion on the sphinx and there has been no water in the area aside from the Nile since around 10,000 B.C., the Sphinx had to have been built before then and not around 3,000 B.C. as believed. The constellation of Leo the Lion was rising directly behind the sun in 10,500 B.C and Orion’s belt was a sign of Osiris, the sun god. Also, around 3,000 B.C., the stars on the Belt of Orion were not yet aligned exactly with the pyramids. The last time the stars were aligned exactly with the pyramids was&#8230;guess when? 10,500 B.C.</p>
<p>So, in 10,500 B.C., extra terrestrial beings from outer space created the Pyramids to correspond to Orion’s Belt and a giant statue of a lion to correspond to the age of Leo, the age in which the Earth was when they visited: An age before the first civilized human beings.</p>
<p>Why isn’t the head of the sphinx still a lion you ask? Thousands of years after the aliens built it, Ramses, the egomaniacal dictator-pharaoh of Egypt, decided that he didn&#8217;t like having the head of a lion on top of a statue in his land.  So, he had a head in his own likeness constructed instead.  But the Egyptians, not being very skilled at huge masonry, built the head somewhat too small and even chipped off a part of its nose. The Egyptians also saw the pyramids and tried to create structures like them but could not achieve their greatness. All later pyramids are either no longer standing or in much poorer shape than the pyramids at Giza, such as the step pyramid at Saqqara which has been reduced to rubble over the years.</p>
<p>So was it the ancient Egyptians who built the pyramids with a massive amount of manpower and an uncanny knowledge of stars and the planet? Or was it in fact aliens? The world may never know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Q: What is your name? Age?</p>
<p>A: My name is Troubles the Clown, I am 9years old, and I was born in the 13<sup>th</sup> month (laughs) figure that one out.</p>
<p>Q: How did you come up with the name Troubles?</p>
<p>A: My momma gave it to me (laughs).</p>
<p>Q: Were you born in Wichita? Were? (North, South, East, West?)</p>
<p>A: Yes, and I’d say, in the middle (laughs).</p>
<p>Q: How long have you been a clown?</p>
<p>A: I’ve been a professional clown since 1991, and I’ve been volunteering as one since 1998.</p>
<p>Q: How di you become a clown?</p>
<p>A: Well a friend of mine had me put on a suit one day to help them volunteer  at a nursing center and I loved it, so I’ve been doing it ever since.</p>
<p>Q: What is your character like?</p>
<p>A: Troubles the Clown is still learning things and growing every day, He’s always trying to make people smile because, “a smile makes the day brighter”, as Troubles always says.</p>
<p>Q: Where did you get your costume?</p>
<p>A: My grandma made it for me. And I got my shoes from Jack’s Shoe Shop. I take them in every six months to get repaired and the last time I took them in they ended up in the newspaper. Turns out a reporter was doing a story over Jack’s Shoe Shop and my shoes happened to be in there (laughs). My shoes were in the paper, but I wasn’t!</p>
<p>Q: Did you go to clown college?</p>
<p>A: I took clown classes through Via Christi. While I was volunteering, another clown named Marbles the clown was talking to me and she said that we should work on my make-up and that’s when I started going to classes.</p>
<p>Q: How do people react when they see you?</p>
<p>A: Most of them are really nice, it’s the bad ones I don’t like (laughs).</p>
<p>Q: What are the bad ones like?</p>
<p>A: Well, most of them just shout rude things but some people have thrown stuff.</p>
<p>Q: What kind of stuff have they thrown?</p>
<p>A: People have thrown bottles of pop and snowballs, and used slingshots, but nothing actually hit me. I have been shot with BB’s before while I was on the corner though.</p>
<p>Q: So how long have you been promoting Talliano’s?</p>
<p>A: About two years now.</p>
<p>Q: Have you done any other promoting?</p>
<p>A: I’ve promoted Godfather’s Pizza and Home Town Buffet. I also do a lot of volunteering for places like Child Start Daycare and Hospice Care of America where I am the professor of a 10 week course on clowing. We’re having a class graduate next month, in fact.</p>
<p>Q: What’s your favorite part about your job?</p>
<p>A: I get to clown around all day (laughs). It’s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Q: Do you work year round?</p>
<p>A: Yes, sometimes people call Talliano’s and tell Frank, (the manager) that I shouldn’t be outside because it’s too cold, but he’ll them that I can come in whenever I want and it’s true. When it’s hot outside I drink a lot of water and sometimes spray my face with a spray bottle, and of course I have my little hat with the spinner on top that I like to call my exhaust system (laughs). When it’s cold I wear a coat, but I love walking around in the snow.</p>
<p>Q: Do you belong to any sort of clown society?</p>
<p>A: I belong to Clowns of America International.</p>
<p>Q: What do you think about coulrophobia, the abnormal or exaggerated fear of clowns?</p>
<p>A: Well, when an adult comes up to me and tells me that he has a friend that is afraid of clowns and wants me to go up and say hi to them, I say no because if they’re afraid of clowns, I don’t want to make them any more afraid than they already are. Sometimes children are acared of me and their parents will drag them up to me to say hi, but usually if the kids want to come up and talk to me they’ll walk up themselves. I don’t want to scare anybody.</p>
<p>Q: Have you seen Stephen King’s movie It?</p>
<p>A: No, I have not and I wouldn’t want to (laughs). I’ve heard about it and I don’t like it because it gives clowns a bad name. Sometimes I just want to tell them “Hey people, I’m a professional clown and you see what this is doing for me and other professional clowns!?” I would never try to scare people, and no other clown I know would either. We don’t want people to be afraid of us.</p>
<p>Q: In your opinion, what do clowns do for our society?</p>
<p>A: A clown can make you forget your troubles. They can make you forget about the real world, even if only for a second, and by doing so, they can make your day brighter.</p>
<p>Q: So how can people get a hold of you if they need to?</p>
<p>A: You can contact me through Talliano’s. I do birthday parties, promotions, and company picnics as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished watching the 9:10 showing of Paranormal Activity 2 at the 21st street Warren, and&#8230;..*shivers*. I&#8217;ll start off with the plot. Don&#8217;t worry though, there will be no spoilers in this article. You soon discover at the beginning, that this movie is actually a prequel to the original Paranormal Activity. It confused me at first when Katie, (the girl from PA1) just happens to be chillin’ out over at this new family&#8217;s house, but it is later stated that this footage is from about 60 days before Mika&#8217;s death and Katie&#8217;s disappearence. The movie starts off with a family bringing home their new-born baby Hunter from the hospital. The family consists of a father named Dan and his daughter from a previous marriage, his second wife Kristi, their hispanic house maid, their German Shepherd Abby, and of course little baby Hunter. Another thing to know is that Kristi is soon revealed to be Katie&#8217;s sister.</p>
<p>A few days after Hunter is brought home from the hospital, the family comes home to what they think is the aftermath of a burglary. The house is trashed as if they had just had a party, but the only thing missing is a necklace that Kristi&#8217;s sister had given her. In order to prevent further break-ins, the family installs six cameras throughout the house. One outside the front door, one over the pool out back, one overlooking the main entrance of the house (including the stairs to the second floor), one in the kitchen, living room (also showing the door to the basement),  and one in Hunter&#8217;s room. Through the lense of these security cameras, including a handheld video camera, we witness the second chapter of Paranormal Activity.</p>
<p>Now, for anyone who disliked the first movie, there is little chance that the second will change your mind. The scares are very similar to the first film, and the reactions to them as well. Because you never know when something is going to happen, you have to stay alert, and it&#8217;s difficult to keep your eyes from scanning the entire screen almost every second of the film. You&#8217;re nerves begin to stand on end every time darkness falls. As soon as it switches to the security camera footage and the words such as &#8220;Night 13: August 9, 2006&#8221; fade onto the screen, you know something bad is going to happen. As the first one did, the second film starts off a bit slow, but makes up for its lack of scares with new plot information and even some comedy. Because not only did this movie make the theatre scream, it made them laugh.</p>
<p>Personally, I loved the first Paranormal Activity. It scared me to death and made it hard to sleep that night, so I had high expectations for the sequel. The way they tie the first and second movie together is quite clever, and the effects are pretty cool, but the truth is that most of the movie is based on anticipation and by that I mean you spend more time waiting for something to happen then seeing things actually happen. The movie was about 75% anticipation, 15% substance, and 10% actual scares. The addition of a family pet and a toddler definitely qualify as a low blow in the film, just because you&#8217;d have to absolutely heartless not to fear for their safety. Also, this movie did nothing to help me get over my fear of dark basements. There were a few jump moments that in my opinion, you could not avoid unless you were paralyzed from the neck down, and when they decided to go &#8220;all out&#8221; with the scares, my heart was pumping a mile a minute and in the back of my mind I was saying &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this is happening right now!&#8221;</p>
<p>The security camera filming style made everything that much more realistic and I had to stop myself a few times from becoming too absorbed in the film by glancing over at the Warren Theatres clock on the wall or examining the chair in front of me. I have found that when I fully absorb myself in a movie it&#8217;s much easier to feel the raw terror that the characters are experiencing and when it comes to Paranormal activity 2, I&#8217;d rather avoid that. In the end, it all depends on what you find scary. Slasher films, with a kitchen knife and gallons of blood. Creatures films, with long fangs and a primal madness. Or Paranormal Activity 2, with falling pots and&#8230;&#8230;well, you&#8217;ll see. It gets to you because it&#8217;s more realistic. We can relate to hearing unexplained noises at night better than being chased by a werewolf, or a man in a jumpsuit and a hockey mask. Paranormal Avtivity 2 gives one explanation for those strange noises you hear at night and suceeds at triggering that &#8220;What if?&#8221; feeling long after you leave the theatre.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone in the world with Internet access may log onto Google Earth and see a pristine satellite image of our expansive school. The North and South parking lots, the baseball field, the soccer fields, the football field and&#8230;oh my. That&#8217;s right, the deep and jagged cracks snaking their way across the span of our 30-year-old tennis courts can be seen and admired from space. Because of this, school administrators decided it was time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Construction of the new tennis courts began in April,&#8221; Jacob Means, athletics director said. &#8220;There&#8217;s still a little dirt work and fencing to be completed on the courts, but the tennis team has been enjoying them since the start of the semester.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old tennis courts had rows of trees on the North, South and West sides, acting as natural windbreakers and providing much needed shade on a hot sunny day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like the new courts,&#8221; junior and varsity tennis player​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​​​​​​​​Kelci Glover said. &#8220;Though there&#8217;s still some work to do, these courts are a lot nicer and more fun to play on. Also, since we&#8217;ve started playing on the new courts more people have come to watch us.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the midst of our economic problems, how do we manage to adopt such a costly addition to our school?</p>
<p>&#8220;A few years ago we voted on a bond issue that has granted our school new turf on the football field as well as these new tennis courts,&#8221; Means said. &#8220;There are eight courts instead of six, and they have an altogether better look and feel to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new courts have a few improvements including, instead of trees, slats in the fence on the North and South ends to block wind and tension rods built underneath the court to keep it from the same cracked and crumbly fate as the old courts. In addition, the shape of the courts create a subtle water slope, eliminating pesky puddles and slippery shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we now have our own nice tennis courts, we no longer have to rely on other public facilities and we may now host our own tennis tournaments,&#8221; Means said.</p>
<p>So what else does the future hold?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ At the moment, Northwest, South, East and Heights have new tennis courts. By this time next year, West, North and South East will have them as well. So a few years from now when Google Earth updates it&#8217;s satellite images, Northwest and six other Wichita high schools will proudly present to the entire world our new and improved tennis courts.</p>
