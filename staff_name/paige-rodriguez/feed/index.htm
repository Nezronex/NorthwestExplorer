										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long tradition of prom being held at the Cotillion, there are expected changes to come in 2015. This year’s prom is going to held at the Scottish Rite Center located near downtown Wichita.</p>
<p>“We wanted a more updated, classier place. Really, it was spearheaded by Mr.Givens, being as he is the senior class principal, he wanted to have it somewhere nicer.” said junior class sponsor Brian Latta.</p>
<p>The Scottish Rite building is cheaper to rent than The Cotillion. The Cotillion was $2,000 to rent with an additional 3 dollars per person, totaling at $3,600. The Scottish Rite Center is about $2,700 after additional charges. Including the DJ and decorations, prom is estimated to cost around $7,000. This years decorations are being made by the Northwest Stagecraft; they will receive payment for their contributions.<br />
“I think we spent a little more money last year on the overall prom decorations so we are actually starting off with less money than we have in the past. “ junior class sponsor Angela Mcdonald said</p>
<p>Prom is being held on an earlier date due to the only other option at the Rite center being  Easter weekend. Other venues such as the Abode and the Indian Center were discussed, but considering their venue sizes and other amenities,  the Scottish Rite Center was the best option.<br />
Despite the change of venue, other traditions will remain. Following the lead of previous years, the junior class makes up the committee that will plan the event. The theme for this years prom will be Belle Noire, meaning “black elegance”.</p>

<li>Respect authority, rules, peers, and staff. You’re only at school for seven hours, you can do it, promise.</li>
<li>Taking lots of notes helps out in the end. Even with how annoying and boring it is taking lots of notes, it makes it easier to study, especially for finals.</li>
<li>Remember, you aren&#8217;t alone. There are hundreds of teens experiencing what you are and you’re surrounded by peers, upperclassmen, and staff that will help you if you ask!</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to make new friends. High school is your “fresh start”. Go in with a good attitude, turn things in, get involved, and make memories with the people around you.</li>
<li>Get involved. It helps the year go by faster and helps your high school years seem like more than just books and work.</li>
<li>Voice any questions you have to other students or staff. Questions are there to be answered, and that’s the point of school: to gain the information you need.</li>
<li>Do your homework. It might seem like busy work, but it actually helps you retain the information.</li>
<li>Procrastinating. As great as it sounds to sit back and watch Netflix rather than doing your homework, it’s better to get things done early rather than waiting till the last minute to get it done.</li>
<li>Get to class. Or rather, don’t stand in the middle of the halls and take up space to talk to your friends. If you have to do that move to the side so people can get around you.</li>
<li>Watch the attitude, this is something that ties in with respect. You might think you’re top-dog, but you’re not, and it’s important to watch what you say. You might think you’re all-that-and-a-bag-of-chips, but, once again, you’re not. It really pays off to take a breather and respect the person you’re talking to.</li>
<li>Remember you’re all in the same boat, everyone has been. Popularity isn’t important, so don’t worry about how you look in the eyes of others. Be confident and get things done.</li>
<li>Don’t sweat it. If you’re having a rough time or getting stressed, take a breather. Go off and play a game for 30 minutes, rant to your best friend, read a book&#8211; do something that helps you relax and then reevaluate the problem.<br />
That essay’s important, but so is your mental and physical health!</li>
<li>Get involved! Attend assemblies, show your pride, be happy to be a grizzly. It makes the school a far better place.</li>
<li>Read the paper, keep up online, and follow our Twitter. It’s quality stuff, and one of the most important things in the school, obviously.</li>
</ol>
