										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">From Nov. 7 to Nov. 11, Northwest’s DECA chapter went on a trip to Chicago. The students, chaperoned by Jeff Darr, who is in charge of DECA, attended a competition focusing on innovation. In all, 32 kids went.</p>
<p>The DECA competition of innovation included schools from all over the United States, such as schools from Georgia and Florida. Northwest did not place this year. The schools had to do an innovative project centered around pencils. They gave pencils a completely new task and idea. Some students made bridges, some heating pads, and some pencils that recorded everything written down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Besides the competition, the students also explored the city of Chicago. The went shopping and eating at Magnificent Mile, a ten-story tall mall, went to Shed Aquarium, and the Willis Tower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sophomore Connor Bobb is a student who went on the trip. He said they enjoyed their stay at the Holiday Inn. “My favorite part of the trip was probably bonding and making new friends,” Bobb said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Yeezus, a.k.a Yeezy, a.k.a Kanye West is a 21st century Michelangelo. He’s a genius. A great thinker. An artist. He’s more than just a rapper. He’s more than just a major a-hole. People are missing the bigger picture.</p>
<p> Kanye West might &#8211; actually, does &#8211; come off as a major douche bag married to one of the most beautiful women in the world. People think he’s arrogant, selfish, and even evil. He has had many crazy incidents, to say the least, in the public media. From taking down paparazzi to speech interruptions at music awards, Mr. West has made himself a worldwide household name.</p>
<p>Kanye. Rapper. Musician. Producer. Director. Fashion designer. Just some of the things on his resume. If I had his schedule and a newly born baby with probably one of the most famous women in the world I’d also be a bona fide “jerk.”</p>
<p>What people don’t understand is that he has contributed so much to the world in many aspects. He’s made some of the best music in rap. He’s made leather pants that you see across fashion blogs across the world. He’s changed the way media is produced and directed. Just take the visuals for his single Black Skinhead as an example.</p>
<p>Even when he was told to change or just quit, he hasn’t given up. He has stayed true to himself. Like he said in one of his rants before, corporation can’t change him.</p>
<p>You see, if you’re a fan of Kanye West then you’re a fan of yourself, which he said in an interview with the BBC. If you like Kanye, then you want to be the best. Better yourself from the ordinary. West fans are usually leaders and people who aren’t afraid to say their thoughts. Go- getters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people who despise Kanye are probably conservatives with low self-esteem who are used to being told what to do. People that just follow and go with the flow. If you just simply don&#8217;t like his music then this doesn&#8217;t apply to you. Even then, everyone should like his music! His music is genius.</p>
<p>People who don’t like Yeezy are probably just jealous that he can do what he wants. Maybe they’re  just jealous that they’re not as happy for themselves as Kanye.</p>
<p>If it was up to me, I’d say we should have more Kanye Wests in this world. People who are leaders, who aren’t afraid to say what they think, and who stand out. That is why Yeezus is the man I look up to the most in this world. I could go on all day and give even more reasons why Kanye is the black Steve Jobs but I’m sure this article will cause enough controversy as it is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest’s Grizzlies For Change will be hosting a first annual clothing drive called Recycle For Youth Sports Clothing Recycle Drive. The drive will begin Oct. 7 and last till the 25. Brian Latta, who is in charge of Grizzlies For Change, will run the drive.</p>
<p>Everything collected in the event will go Goodwill. For every pound of clothes collected, the school will receive 10 cents. If the school gets up to 1000 pounds, then we will enter a drawing for $1000.</p>
<p>“This is the first time the school has ever done it,” Latta said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grizzlies For Change is also in charge of other clothes drives around the year. The two clothing bins outside on the 13th St. side of the school are managed by the organization. They get picked up yearly by Goodwill as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">On Friday, Sept. 13, journalism teacher Rebekah Morse took five Northwest students to the Kansas State Fair for the Kansas State Fair Scholastic Press Corps Print Competition. The purpose of the contest was to print, interview, write stories, take photos, and then design a four-page newsletter.</p>
<p> The competition started at 8 a.m. and lasted all day until 6 p.m., which was the final deadline. Judging took place over the weekend. The schools will be contacted with the results.</p>
<p>The students who went were sophomores Haley Cooper and Emily Dulohery and seniors Lyndi McIntyre, Kira Crafton and Grace Buckingham.</p>
<p>“Even if we don’t place, I’m still glad we went,” says Morse, “it was a nice way to get out of the school setting and report on something different, and show our true skills.”</p>
<p>It was a fairly nice day, no pun intended. The weather was in the mid-70’s. The day started out really slow and got more busy as the day went on.</p>
<p>Sophomore Haley Cooper covered and wrote about the 4H Horse Show.</p>
<p>“It was a good experience,” Cooper said. “It was a very real world application of reporting. I feel like we did a good job.”</p>
