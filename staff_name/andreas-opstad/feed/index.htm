										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 7th movie in the Harry Potter series is probably the movie with the highest expectations by far. The previous movie ended in the middle of the action and excitement, and Deathly Hallows picked it right back up. Shortly after the curtains went up, the curses were flying though the air and people were falling off their broomsticks. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) along with his loyal friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), continue what Dumbledore started. The trio tries to find the horcruxes, objects that make Voldemort immortal. Once the horcruxes are destroyed the three will be able to kill Voldemort once and for all. But Voldemort is not going to make it easy for them.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord&#8217;s power is growing stronger every day. One of Voldemort’s followers gets announced to the new Minister of Magic. The ministry puts up &#8220;Wanted” posters with big rewards for whoever catches Harry. So he hides and cannot show himself to the public and can’t trust anyone but his closest friends. After Harry’s principal, mentor and good friend Dumbledore died, he left small clues to the next horcruxes, leaving Harry and his friends to figure it out.</p>
<p>They spend most of their days in a tent in the forest and get their friendship tested. The romance between Ron and Hermione keeps appearing, but as Hermione and Harry spend a lot of time together, Ron starts to get very jealous.</p>
<p>Even though this may sound cliché for some audiences, the movie (that lasts for almost 2 and a half hours) has a lot of action, combined with romance, friendship and mystery. The last few movies have missed many important scenes from the books, making it hard to follow and understand the magic world J.K. Rowling created. This time, director David Yates decided to split the book in two movies and made sure to tell the whole story. But why didn&#8217;t he think of this earlier? Having read the book, seeing many of the scenes from the book also in the movie was pleasant. But I also believe it makes for a better movie for those who haven’t read the book. All over, this was a very good movie and I can&#8217;t wait for the second part.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>September 16 the JV soccer team played against Derby V. The game started with confusion, “where is Coach Rooney? He is never late.”</p>
<p>Ten minutes after the team was suppose to meet coach Rooney ran across the field and quickly gathered his players in a circle. Then captain junior David Luico asked coach if he had a good day, the reply was clear “I’m pretty good, I just had a baby.”</p>
<p>Coach Rooney had to leave shortly after his arrival. Coach Bribiesca lead the team in the first half and Coach Shook took over in second. Neither Bribiesca nor Shook could coach them through warm-up so the team had to warm up on their own and attempt to stay focused the whole time.</p>
<p>Captains David Luico and Austin Haase, both juniors, had to take some extra responsibility.</p>
<p>“We had to take charge during warm-up,” Haase said, “We completely respect Rooney,” Juico adds. The two captains decided that the game was dedicated to Rooney’s son, JP.</p>
