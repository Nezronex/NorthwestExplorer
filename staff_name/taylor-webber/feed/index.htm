										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A devastating loss by WSU in the March Madness tournament left much of Wichita and the Northwest student body brokenhearted after their game against Kentucky on Sun. March 23.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Both teams played a great game, unfortunately the last shot didn’t go in for the win,” sophomore Danielle Kastner said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">WSU managed a record-breaking 35-1 season that kept Wichita cheering for more, “I was at the Northwest YMCA when the game was on, all the people would go workout on the commercials and as soon as the game was back on they would all run back in and surround the TV,” sophomore Jacob Gilbertson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although they lost early on in the March Madness tournament Wichita is still showing their support wholeheartedly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The Shockers had an amazing season, they made history which no one in Wichita will ever forget,” Kastner said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wichita had one of the best records, coming from a small college in Kansas making people from all over watch.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to regret from this season, the team will come back even stronger next year and prove again what they can do,” Kastner said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Northwest girls basketball team had a sad ending to their season of hard work that left them emotional on Wed. March 5. The team lost to Garden City in a 66-40 game, resulting in them being eliminated from qualifying for state.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At the beginning we were working really hard and doing well holding them, but they went on a run of points and we couldn’t stop them,” said sophomore Haley Cooper. At halftime the score 29-12 Garden City.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We went from a run of 8-0 at the beginning of the game to that, it was a little disappointing,” said Cooper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The game was played in Garden City, so the team had to stay after the loss to watch the Northwest boys play, who also had a tragic 3 point loss.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We were trying to be supportive of the guys during their game but when we got back into the locker room it was very emotional since it was the seniors last game,” said Cooper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team finished with a 9-12 record.</p>
<p>“Ultimately it would have been nice to have a happier ending, but it was a good experience, despite it all we functioned as a team unit and were supportive the whole season,” said Cooper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valentines Day, the day every year where people either feel loved by their significant other or the day where people stay at home wishing they were feeling loved. If you’re one of those people who is feeling a bit lonely this year, here are some tips for a better Valentines Day.<br />
1. Hang out with friends, (lets be honest they’re probably just as lonely as you are).<br />
2. Buy yourself flowers, and act surprised when you receive them.<br />
3. Watch romantic movies and eat ice cream, crying when you please.<br />
4. Go to Applebee’s and order the 2 for $20 menu all for yourself.<br />
5. Dress up nice and take yourself out on a date to the movies.<br />
6. Have your mother buy you a giant teddy bear from Dillon’s that way you have something to cuddle with at night.<br />
7. Take a nap, (because who doesn’t love sleep)?<br />
8. Throw a party with all the other singles and enjoy your night!<br />
9. Go on a run to start getting that body you’ve always wanted.<br />
10. Go out with friends and meet someone new because you’re way too amazing to be sitting at home by yourself.<br />
These tips are to have a fun lonely Valentines Day, but Valentines Day is just another day in the year that you could spend making fun memories, don’t let feeling lonely bring you down this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest’s wrestling team has been accomplishing all they set out for so far this season. The team is 5-0 in the City League. “We have eight kids ranked for state already, so I’d say that we’re doing well,” wrestling coach Eric Prichard said. The team has won every tournament they have been to so far including Wellington, Pratt, and Bishop Carrol. “The team is right where I want them to be right now,” Prichard said. Northwest is going for their 3rd straight City League championship. “I really want us to go for a three-peat, I don’t think its been done before yet,” Prichard said. The wrestlers most recently had a 49-18 win against Heights on Wednesday, Jan. 29. “I’m looking forward to finishing the year strong, and really hoping for a top three finish at state this year,” Prichard said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Northwest girls won their first game 53-33 against North on Dec. 6, and demolished West in their second game  with a 67-21 score on Dec. 10.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s always a great experience,” sophomore Shaunece Grant said on her first year playing with the varsity team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The girls have started off great so far and are improving in their practices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So far as a team we have gotten better each game, so I hope that continues,” Grant said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve been turning the ball over a lot so we have been focusing on keeping the ball in practice, I think our hard work will pay off in our next game against South,” sophomore Haley Cooper said.</p>
<p>Their next game is on Tuesday, Dec. 17 at home against South.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest High School journalism students were inducted into Quill and Scroll International Honorary Society on Thursday, Oct. 17. Being inducted into Quill and Scroll is an honor for selected students every year district-wide who have been in journalism for a year, have a 3.0 GPA, and have contributed in some way to the newspaper or yearbook.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it’s a great way to recognize my students who work really hard to put out their publications,” journalism teacher Rebekah Morse said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the induction all inductees are brought up on stage and announced by their adviser. Each inductee receives a pin and cords to wear at graduation. Guest speaker Lily Wu from KAKE News came and spoke to the inductees and their families and gave tips on careers in journalism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other high schools with students inducted that night include East, Eisenhower, Goddard, Heights, North, South, Southeast, and West.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These kids spend a lot of their time trying to make sure everything is up to date and care a lot about what they’re doing,” Morse said.</p>
<p>Benefits to being inducted are being in an honorary society and building resumes. Morse would like to build Quill and Scroll up and start doing community service in the future.</p>
