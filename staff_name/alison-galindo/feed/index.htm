<p>Star signs, everyone has one yet not everybody knows what they mean. Overall horoscopes are supposed to represent how a person acts in everyday life. Take into example a person who is a Taurus (April 19-May 20), they are supposed to be stubborn yet at the same time be artistic and overall enjoy a luxurious life. On the other hand, there are the Libras (September 22-0ctober 22), these people are supposed to be well balanced as well as charming. The star sign often being represented by a scale.</p>
<p>The big question is: Do the students at Northwest relate to their horoscopes?</p>
<p>Lea-cher Kennedy, freshman, said that she does not know much about star signs therefore she does not have a clear answer to them.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in them too much, but there are certain coincidences where I’ll be reading something about my horoscope and be like, “Hey, that actually does sound like me,” Kennedy said.</p>
<p>Bethany Cortus, senior, said that from the little she does know about her sign, she does feel like she relates to it.</p>
<p>“I would consider myself a little like my sign. We share similar characteristics, as in being caring and having a sensitive soul. Although from there I would think that we are not very alike,” Cortus said.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous two students, Pranav Prasad, freshman, does know a lot about his sign. Pranav said that he was a Libra. He feels like his sign does describe him well.</p>
<p>“I am a social whirl, like how people from my horoscope tend to be. It can be a good thing or a bad thing, but I take it as a good thing. I am also a very loyal person, so in the end, Prasad said. &#8220;Yes, I do believe I relate to my horoscope.”</p>
<p>Star signs are an interesting thing to look at. Many do not know what a star sign is until they look it up for themselves. If you have not read about yours, why not do it? See if you relate to one of the students above.</p>
<p>“I think everybody should read about their horoscope; I didn’t know much about mine until recently, but they are pretty interesting,” Kennedy said.</p>

<p>Traveling is one of the many enjoyable things people like to do during the holidays. The question is: Is it safe to travel? This year has been a harsh one, especially with the world-wide pandemic going around. Now with the holidays steadily approaching families are faced with the tough decision that is traveling.</p>
<p>Following what the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) says if you do plan to travel, do it wisely. Consider your community. If there are cases spiking it is best not to travel. Another thing to take into consideration would be where you are traveling to. See if there are coronavirus cases spiking there. This is because airports, bus stations, train stations, public transports, and many other public places are prone to be exposed to the virus. Either it is on the surface or in the air. If you do still plan to travel these are the best things to take into consideration: Wear a mask in public settings, avoid close contact with anyone, wash your hands regularly, avoid touching your face, and finally stand 6 feet apart from people. Overall, the CDC says that the best option is to stay home. It is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>What does this mean for Kansas? This recent week Kansas has seen a massive spike of coronavirus cases. Amounting to an average of 2,439 new cases per day. What do the people at Northwest think?</p>
<p>Crystal Kerr, science, said her family has decided not to visit this Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They are better able to distance, but cases in the community are very high right now. We have been about as careful with safety precautions as we can, but I don’t want to accidentally transmit something to others.”</p>
<p>Kerr said that she believes that even if that does mean she can&#8217;t see her family, she would rather them remain safe and healthy.</p>
<p>What do the students at Northwest think? Matthew Altgilbers freshman, said it&#8217;s not a clear cut decision.</p>
<p>“It all depends on the destination. If you have been exposed to people within the two weeks of travel, do not travel.” He went on to say that if you do end up traveling to take all the precautions into consideration in order to be able to be in a safe environment.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this year has been a tough one but if people are safe there can be brighter holidays ahead.</p>
<p>“It is sad, but I feel like it is the right decision,” Kerr said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">Athletes often say that their team feels like a family, but for this year&#8217;s varsity volleyball team, it was more than a feeling. The team had something happen to them that has never occurred before. This year there are three pairs of sisters all playing for the girls’ varsity volleyball team ranging all the way from freshman to senior. </span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Freshman Camdyn </span><span data-contrast="none">Stucky said her bond with her sister, junior Caiya Stucky has deepened by having her as a teammate.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;“W</span><span data-contrast="none">e have</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;been&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">close</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;our whole lives but being on the high school volleyball team brings something&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">totally new</span><span data-contrast="none">. Our relationship has grown so much, and I am so thankful for that,</span><span data-contrast="none">” Camdyn said.</span><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;Camdyn said she values this volleyball seas</span><span data-contrast="none">on since it is one of two that she gets to spend alongside her sister. The other sibling sets on the team were also very positive about how this experience impacts their relationships</span><span data-contrast="none">. They all mentioned that if all of them did not play for the same team, they felt as if the bond of the whole team had would have drastically changed. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;“</span><span data-contrast="auto">Having these sisters on our team definitely makes practices and honestly all of our time together so much more fun. Our whole team has grown to become family,</span><span data-contrast="auto">” sophomore Daetyn Bogle said.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Daetyn</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and her sister </span><span data-contrast="auto">Brailee</span><span data-contrast="auto"> Bogle both play for the varsity team. The both agreed that their connection is on another level since they have been playing together for five years. The sisters said they think the amount of time they have played together helps them understand each other on and off the court. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The other set of siblings on the team this year are the Corcoran sisters, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Jacqueline</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jaicee</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;Jacqueline</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;is a&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">freshman</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;while her si</span><span data-contrast="auto">s</span><span data-contrast="auto">ter&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jaicee</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;is a senior.&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jacqueline said she was grateful for the board of education&#8217;s decision to allow fall sports so that she didn&#8217;t lose her only chance to be on the team with Jaicee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">The best thing about having my sister on the team is knowing&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">there is always&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">someone</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;to push you and knowing that we can’t take this season for granted. We didn’t think we would get to play at first and that made both&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Jaicee</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and I really upset knowing this is our only year to get to play together, so when we got our season back we knew that we had to make it special.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The team ended their season as sub-state champions and in the top eight of the state in the 6A category with a record of 14-2. According to coach Adriana Leake, all of the other teams at state had gotten to play over 30 games this season while Northwest had played fewer games due to the late start for their season.</span></p>
<p>Leake said having sisters really modeled to the rest of the team how they could have strong disagreements, as siblings sometimes do, but then come back together. And she appreciated the increased communication.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nice because in a lot of ways the team chemistry was already built in,&#8221; Leake said.</p>
