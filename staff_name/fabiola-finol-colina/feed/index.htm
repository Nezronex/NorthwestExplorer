										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this past summer on July 21st, movie theaters were packed with people going to see one of two very different movies. On one side of the room all you could see were booming pink outfits, on the other established and distinct suits. This event was known on social media as “Barbenheimer” which is the combination of the names of the two movies that were premiering that day, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This double premiere made a great deal of noise due to both movies having very recognizable directors and actors behind it. People were making plans on which one they would see first and also what outfits they would wear to match the vibe of each movie.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the crowds started to disperse and all the popcorn had been popped, people were quick to voice their opinions on how they felt over the movies, and Northwest students did not fall behind.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I went to see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">because honestly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn’t interest me like the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movie did, and personally I loved it. I felt like it was really good commentary on womanhood, but also the struggles that both men and women face in society,” Audrey Buser (11) said.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved to be one of the most successful movies of the year so far making $1.34 billion and while Buser has only seen </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there’s equally other students that have only seen </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did not see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went to go see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppenheimer </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m kind of a historical guy, I really like movies about the past and I’m also a little bit of a WWII geek so I like anything from that time, but I thought the movie was a little too long and I noticed it didn’t get a lot of promotion. I didn’t know of it until I saw a trailer at the movie theater,” Gabriel Bakker (12) said.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some students didn’t just see one movie, but instead went to both showings and were able to witness all the trends that took place.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to see Oppenheimer because it looked like a visually good movie and I thought it would be really good at IMAX, but I also wanted to see Barbie because it felt like a fun movie to go to and a fun thing to be at the theater for,” Elijah Gegen (12) said.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gegen expressed his excitement and reason for wanting to see both movies and very quickly gave us his thoughts after seeing them, he also told us which one he liked better.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a hard decision, but I think I liked Oppenheimer better, Barbie had some really good messages and it was just a fun movie to see, but with Oppenheimer I think it was like a really historically accurate movie and I feel like you know someone for one thing, but there’s also so much other things that happened for that to happen,” Gegen added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The orchestra had its last concert of the 2022-23 school year, Tuesday, May 16th, which was a perfect goodbye for the seniors. Compared to the school’s band, the orchestra is not as visible, given that they don’t perform during pep rallies or sporting events. During this concert they had three sections; the Sinfonietta Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, and Concert Orchestra.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sinfonietta section was titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cruisin’ Around the World,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and they played Adventure on the High Seas, Lijiang River Landscape, Ye Bonnie Banks ‘n’ Braes, and Caribbean Cruise. The Chamber section was titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Takes Two Bears to Tango, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and they played La Bamba, Manhā de Carnaval, and Por Una Cabeza. Lastly, the Concert section was titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seniors on Broadway </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and they did a mashup of a few songs from these three musicals, Mamma Mia with solos from Ruth Arrasmith, Isabella Straight, and Elexis Williams, Beauty and the Beast with solos from Carolina Contreras, Renee Amaya, Lizbeth Diaz, and Ruth West, and then Hamilton with solos from Sophia Anderson, Kristina Guitierrez, Luis Piedra, and Brayden Hoang.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the last section of the concert the director, Madeline Crawford gave some awards, these included letters, certificates, and cords for the seniors, and then she awarded two students for showing great amounts of leadership. Isabella Straight got the National School Orchestra Award, voted by her fellow classmates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt shocked because even though I have been a concertmaster for five years I’m not always the nicest person,” said Straight (12).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The next one was Director’s Choice Award and it went to Elexis Williams, as the name suggests this was chosen by their director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was grateful and excited that my work during the year was being recognized,” said Williams (12).</span></p>
