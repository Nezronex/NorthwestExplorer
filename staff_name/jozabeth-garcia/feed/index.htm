										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year of 2015 has started, and reality is coming soon for the senior class of 2015. Don’t get me wrong, not having class all day is awesome, but I sit at home always thinking of what exactly I’m going to do with my life.</p>
<p>Many of us have already decided on what we’re doing after high school, college acceptance letters have arrived in your mailbox and the only thing you have to decide is what school you’re going to. </p>
<p>For the rest of us, we still don’t know what to do. It’s not that we don’t want to go to college, but we just can’t afford it, we want to work, or go into the military. Maybe some of us had plans, but they just didn’t turn out the way we wanted.</p>
<p>So, now what? Graduation is a day closer as the days go by. We’ve already presented our senior speeches, and the next big thing is probably prom.</p>
<p>I’m so stressed out, and I know many of you are too. I constantly ask myself, “What am I going to do after the summer is over?” My mom repeatedly asks how excited I am to finally graduate, but honestly I am dreading it. It’s not that I don’t want to graduate, it’s just, how am I going to become the person I have always wanted to be? How am I going to reach the top? Many of us are scared of failing, and I am probably the most scared.</p>
<p>I remember many people telling me that high school was going to fly by, and to never skip school because it was bad, and that it was going to be the best years of your life. Many of us can relate, and to be honest, those people were right. It was dumb to skip math (I found that out myself by spending my summer in summer school), and it was definitely not very smart to stress over things like boys and drama than missing out on football games and homecomings. </p>
<p>I do regret many things, like skipping out on the pep assemblies and not being involved in school more than I wanted to, but the end is coming soon, and there&#8217;s just no time to sit and think about all the things we could&#8217;ve done. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s live it up. Spend your last days like a true senior, smile, enjoy the last few walks through these halls, show your teachers a little more appreciation. Just a few more months until that diploma. </p>
<p>Overall, you can&#8217;t deny that these last 4 years weren&#8217;t worth it. </p>
<p>It’s ok to be scared for the future, just be bold. It’s ok to freak out, just stay on track. Don’t just dream, but make it all a reality. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Nigg was nominated for the Coach of the Year award and inducted into the Wrestling Hall of Fame located in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The banquet to honor him will be held in Derby on April 19.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s really an honor,&#8221; Nigg said. &#8220;Usually, a lot of times they&#8217;ll wait to nominate you until you die. But I&#8217;m still around.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is being honored for the second overall win-loss record, having over 184 dual wins, multiple appearances in the top four at state, and winning state. Additionally, he is being recognized for being a part of the wrestling community for so many years. </p>
<p>Being around for 38 years, Nigg has worked with assistant coach Mike Church and Eric Prichard, head coach of the wrestling team. Including the years Prichard wrestled for Nigg, they have been together for a total of 23 years. Nineteen of those have been coaching.</p>
<p>“I wrestled for him back in 1988 for six years, four years in highschool and two in college.” Prichard said. “I went to college, came back in 1996 and started coaching with him. He’s been so successful here, we’re proud of him and I think it was about time.”</p>
<p>Prichard will also be attending the banquet, as well as introducing the hall of famer. Nigg will receive a plaque and a jacket.</p>
<p>Setting aside his award and success, he says it’s not for the recognition, but for the students and to teach them the sport. </p>
<p>“It’s rewarding to be surrounded by such good kids, not to just wrestle for college, but to have success,” Nigg said.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day of 21-year-old Kaleb Bonilla’s funeral, Northwest students wore blue to show their support for junior Rosemary Bonilla. </p>
<p>The idea was brought on by junior Chelsee Cushenbery who then proceeded to organize the whole event. Cushenbery asked concert choir to help out by recording the group singing “We Lift You Up”, and sending it to Bonilla hoping to lift her spirits. </p>
<p>“It was after the funeral I had looked at my phone and saw the notification,” Bonilla said, “I was like, ‘Wow, they did that for me.’ I was just like, ‘dang that makes me feel good.’”</p>
<p>On Jan. 17, Bonilla unexpectedly lost her brother, Kaleb. Coming back to school she expected to be overwhelmed by her peers after the incident, but she realized she had more supporters than she ever thought. </p>
<p>“It just made me feel really good that it helped her, and her knowing that there are people out there that still care and are here supporting her,” Cushenbery said.</p>
<p>News spread fast with the help of Twitter and Instagram. It mostly started out with juniors, but then everyone began tweeting #Blue4Rose, telling everyone to wear blue in honor of Kaleb. </p>
<p>“We all love Rose. She’s been there for so many people, so I just wanted to try to be there for her,” Cushenbery said. </p>
