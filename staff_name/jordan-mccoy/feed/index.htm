										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t want to grow up, I don&#8217;t want to have to worry about financial problems and whether or not I can buy a house or car on my own. I just want to enjoy life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most teens they have no idea what they will be doing this weekend, let alone what they will be doing when they are older. Reality U is a program aimed toward sophomores in high school to show them where they will be when they are 25 years old and to show them what income their planned career would realistically get them. They look at your current grades, what you want your career to be, and whether a student plans on being married or having kids. With this information, they calculate the amount of money the student will earn every month. It helps them realize that while they do have enough money to buy what they need, they need to be wise with their money.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During English class sophomores were sent to the gym to participate in Reality U where you go around to different booths buying the basic things we need to live, like housing, lighting and water, a car, child care, clothes, health insurance, groceries, and hobbies. They even have a chance booth that can either give you money or lose it, depending on your luck.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My paper said that I was single, living with zero kids, and had a career in journalism. I earned about $2,500.00 a month. I was overwhelmed. How am I supposed to know how to correctly spend my money? What if I go into debt? I jumped right in and went for it.</p>
<p>After I went through all the booths and bought everything I needed, I was left with only $250.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was one of the lucky ones. Some other sophomores were in debt after buying everything, and some were even divorced with multiple kids to take care of.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This was my first “real-world” experience and I learned a lot from it. It made me realize that it’s not that bad being an adult (from a financial point of view, that is). It showed me that as long as you make good money decisions, you can live your life however you want. And it also showed me that I have plenty of time to grow up, so I might as well enjoy being a kid while I can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Palms sweating. Legs shaking. Arms tingling. This is it. It’s coming. There’s no escaping it. You cant hide from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finals week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For years, finals have terrified many Northwest students. Luckily for them, the Northwest finals policy has never made them take the finals if they are passing and have 3 or less absences. However, the policy may be changing. The new principal, Mr. Alvarez is thinking of changing the policy, making it mandatory for all the students to take finals no matter what your grade is or how many absences you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some students are indifferent about the new policy while some are mad about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They should make it required,” said Jordyn Bibbs, sophomore. “Because you have to take them in college and I&#8217;m hoping more kids here want to go to college after high school. Its helping you get ready for that because if you never take finals you never know what to expect. You will expect a big test but you don&#8217;t exactly know what kind of questions and what kind of things you have to prepare for.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some students feel that they should make it mandatory, but with some sort of requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t think we should make finals mandatory until our senior year to at least prepare us one year for college to see what we can do.” said Caylin Cabral, sophomore . “If you have an A then you should not be forced to take it but if you can you can. But if you have an B or lower it should be mandatory no matter what because I don&#8217;t think absences matter.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some teachers are making their students take some kind of final in class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I&#8217;m making all of my students take the finals this year on the last day of class because if I can help them in some tiny way to make them take finals more seriously and not be scared of them then I feel that I think it’s important that they take the finals.” said Miss McDonald, history teacher. “Its not something to get out of or fear or hate it should be embraced by students to show the amount of information they&#8217;ve learned this year.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whether or not you have to take finals, don’t be afraid. They will come and pass. Just hang in there and remember, finals are not monsters in your closet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Many students have turned away from the TV and have started relying on Netflix to watch their favorite TV shows. But what are they watching? After asking around Northwest, here are the results. (Results are listed in no particular order)</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Doctor Who</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a special year for the “Whovians”; Doctor Who is celebrating fifty years of being on the air, making it the longest-running sci-fi series of all time. Doctor Who started in the nineteen-sixties, was cancelled, brought back on the air with a TV movie, and finally rebooted in 2006.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The show follows the adventures of the Doctor, an alien who travels throughout time and space in his TARDIS with his human companions. Full of memorable characters, smart plot lines and moments that make you cry your eyes out, Doctor Who is not only a good show, it is a good story.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Come on, look at me! No plan, no backup, no weapons worth a damn, oh, and something else I don&#8217;t have: anything to lose! So, if you&#8217;re sitting up there in your silly little space ships with all your silly little guns, and you&#8217;ve got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight, just remember who&#8217;s standing in your way! Remember every black day I ever stopped you, and then, and then, do the smart thing! Let somebody else try first. -The 11th Doctor, Season Five: The Pandorica Opens</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vIsQ25Krq8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vIsQ25Krq8</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">-Whitney</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Merlin</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it often gets overshadowed by other BBC shows, Merlin was the first show for a very long time to air on a major American TV broadcaster: NBC. Although it ended last Christmas with an amount of viewers to rival Doctor Who, people are still watching it on Netflix. The show puts a twist on the King Arthur Legend: Arthur and Merlin are the same age, and magic is punishable by death in Camelot. Every character changes immensely throughout the series and each has a secret. The relationships are  done tastefully, the plots were excellent, friendship between the characters made the show, and the snappy dialogue set it apart from other medieval shows. The US tagline for the show says it best: Some fight for justice, others fight for power, all fight for Camelot. Personally, out of all the TV shows on this list, Merlin is my favorite.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">The love that binds us is more important than the power we wield. -Mordred, Season Five: Arthur’s Bane Part Two</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBWbU5BvA0o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBWbU5BvA0o</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">-Whitney</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Star Trek: TOS</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have not seen this series,  you have been living under a rock. While it was canceled after its third season back in the 60’s, it became a cult classic, resulting in five spin-off TV series, two movies set in an alternate timeline and 10 original movies. The series follows Captain Kirk,  Mr. Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and other memorable crew members of the starship Enterprise as they explore the galaxy and new civilizations. Star Trek has well-formed characters and original plotlines that really make you think- something that really sets it apart. If you have not seen Star Trek, why are you still reading this? Go and catch up on what you have been missing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">You may find that having is so pleasing a thing as wanting. This is not logical, but often true.-Mr. Spock, Amok Time</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8bY619HLQc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8bY619HLQc</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">-Whitney</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Pretty Little Liars</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s getting intense for all those PLL fanatics. A’s identity is close to being  revealed. In this TV drama/ thriller, four friends come together to discover an anonymous enemy who threatens the safety of all their darkest secrets, masking itself as A. Throughout this series, these friends come close to unraveling their best friend Alison DiLarentis&#8217; murder, while on many occasions, they come close to their own demise. Lately, it&#8217;s hard to know who’s telling the truth and who isn&#8217;t, who’s in cahoots with A and who’s not. Secrets are coming out and relationships are being tested, while lines are being crossed and mysteries are bubbling to the surface. This TV mystery definitely keeps you at the edge of your seat. You never know who’s next on A’s list.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The rich girls steal, the pretty girls lie, the smart girls play dumb and the dumb girls spend their days trying to be all of the above.&#8221; &#8211; Caleb, Season Three: Episode 14.</p>

<p dir="ltr">-Allison</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-The Walking Dead</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on a comic book series by Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead  follows a group of humans on the run in Georgia after a zombie apocalypse. Something that makes the series unique is that  the The Walking Dead focuses on human nature and portrays it very accurately. It shows a side of people only brought out by the worst of times. Characters develop beautifully if not always the way we want them to, but insanity is made to be beautiful through the story and excellent writing” instead of the cut-zombies-in-two approach. While the show doesn’t exactly have a consistent cast of characters, there are quite a few fan favorites, which says something about the writers: they can consistently come up with good and complex characters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote: You are going to beat this world, I know you will. You are smart, and you are strong, and you are so brave, and I love you. You gotta do what&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s so easy to do the wrong thing in this world. So, so, if it feels wrong don&#8217;t do it, alright? If it feels easy don&#8217;t do it, don&#8217;t let this world spoil you. -Lori,  Season Three: Killer Within</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSi2fJALDyQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSi2fJALDyQ</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">-Whitney</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">-Sherlock</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sherlock is a mini-series based on the short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle.  The series is set in modern-day London, and features the iconic duo of Sherlock Holmes and Captain John Watson chasing criminals, solving cases, getting themselves into the weirdest situations (showing up in Buckingham palace in a bedsheet) and unraveling the mystery that is professor Moriarty. The series is hilarious, there are memorable one-liners, fantastic actors,  incredibly twisted plots and  horrifying season finales. All in all, Sherlock is something that can appeal to anyone and everyone, including me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Listen, John what I said before, I meant it. I don’t have friends. I’ve just got one. –Sherlock Holmes, Season Two: The Hounds of Baskerville</p>

<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Breaking Bad</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chemistry teacher Walter White has a normal life. He lives in the quiet town of Albuquerque New Mexico with his wife and his 15 year old son. He has a nice job as a high school chemistry teacher. And with a baby on the way, everything seems great.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When he finds out he has lung cancer, he&#8217;s devastated. What will happen when he dies? How will his family survive without him? How can he make money for his family? What should a chemistry teacher do?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sell drugs, obviously.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the help of one of his former students, Jesse, they cook and sell pure crystal meth. He must hide his secret from his family and especially his brother-in-law, who happens to be a DEA agent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Breaking Bad has 5 seasons and each season has about 12 episodes. It has ended but you can watch it on AMC or on Netflix.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I have spent my whole life scared, frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen, 50-years I spent like that. Finding myself awake at three in the morning. But you know what? Ever since my diagnosis, I sleep just fine. What I came to realize is that fear, that’s the worst of it. That’s the real enemy. So, get up, get out in the real world and you kick that bastard as hard you can right in the teeth.” &#8211; Walter White</p>

<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Supernatural</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hunting demons is all a part of the family business for Dean and Sam Winchester.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When they were younger, Sam and Dean’s mother was killed by a demon. Shortly after, their house burns down. Their dad, heartbroken, becomes a “hunter,” a person who hunts demons and monsters, in order to find the demon that killed his wife and his sons’ mother. He also teaches his 8 and 6-year-old sons how to hunt demons. Years after their mother&#8217;s death, Sam leaves his family to become a lawyer. Dean stays with his dad and continues hunting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">20 years after their mother&#8217;s death, Dean visits Sam at college and tells him that he hasn&#8217;t heard from their dad in a few weeks and he thinks he’s been a hunting accident. Sam reluctantly comes along to help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Supernatural is currently on its 9th season and it can be viewed on the CW Channel.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-New Girl</p>
<p>After not-so-patient waiting, the second season has finally arrived on Netflix. In this comedic TV series, Jess, a quirky school teacher who is known to spontaneously burst into song, finds herself moving into a loft with three guys she came across on Craigslist: Nick, a bartender who dropped out of law school; Schmidt, a flashy personality who believes he&#8217;s a god and has been placed on the earth as a gift to women; and Winston, a former athlete who just has no idea what he&#8217;s going to do with his life. This dysfunctional group of friends are always there for one another, helping each other in their darkest and stupidest moments. While living under the same roof, relationships get complicated and jumbled. In the end, however, they are the true definition of a family. This TV series absolutely brings a little sunshine and laughter to your day; its hard to stop watching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I could pretend to be more like you, Jess, and live on a sparkly rainbow and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time.&#8221; &#8211; Nick, Season 1: Episode 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Remember back in the day when you wanted to hang out with someone you actually had to walk to their house and ask them in person? Or when you wanted to reconnect with old friends you   would call them or write to them?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Me neither.</p>
<p>From Facebook to Twitter, social media has become an important part of people’s everyday lives. Want to talk to old family members? Get a Facebook. Want to show off your photos? Download Instagram. Want to make a video? Just put it on YouTube. Want to tell the entire world that you have swag? Well&#8230;there&#8217;s Twitter.</p>
<p>Social media is an amazing thing really. You can talk to people from the other side of the country as long as you have a decent Internet connection. Without social media it would be hard to keep up with family and friends. And even harder to keep up with current events.</p>
<p>The Internet has become an important part of everyday life, from keeping up with family to keeping up with the weather. It just shows how much technology has grown in the past ten years. And just think, the Internet may be considered “old fashioned” in ten more years.</p>
<p>Speaking of social media, you should follow us on our Facebook page and on Twitter. We would really appreciate it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 11, 2013, the Syfy channel released its new original movie, Sharknado. This movie was very helpful in dealing with a Sharknado, if you ever have the opportunity of experiencing one. Without a doubt this was one of the best movies of 2013 and deserves an Oscar for both acting and animation.</p>
<p>That’s what I would say if Syfy was paying me to do this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sharknado wasn&#8217;t Syfy’s finest movie. Along with a lot of puns and horrible CGI sharks, you&#8217;re pretty much wasting an evening. Ian Ziering, who was also in the TV show Beverly Hills 90210, plays our hero Fin Shepard (the hero’s name is Fin, and this is a movie about sharks- this is very fishy), the owner of a popular bar. With the help of his ex-wife and his bar employees, they speed around Los Angeles trying to save people from the dreaded flying sharks and also robbing convenience stores for their guns and chainsaws along the way. I don&#8217;t want to spoil the ending for you, but let’s just say that thanks to this movie we now know how to stop a Sharknado. Thanks Syfy!</p>
<p dir="ltr">The premiere of Sharknado gained around 2.1 million views and over 5,000 tweets per minute on Twitter. That’s a lot of hype for a poorly made movie. Thanks to all the views, Syfy has announced that they will be making a sequel. With the help of Twitter, the title  for the sequel is Sharknado 2: The Second One. They plan on releasing it next summer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite how amazingly bad it is, you should watch it at least once. It’s a cult classic. Sharknado has been released on DVD and is still currently being replayed on the Syfy channel. Who knows? Maybe this movie will come in handy someday when we experience our own Sharknado.</p>
<p dir="ltr">(Side note: I actually love this movie and I’m just poking fun at its mistakes. It’s a really great movie and I really think that you should watch it.)</p>
