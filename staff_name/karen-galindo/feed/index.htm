<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AnimeFest attendee: Eleanor Cornwell</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What got you interested in anime?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “My sister started reading a lot of the comic books when we were younger and then eventually I started reading some of those. I had, technically, been watching anime since I was a really little kid; I didn’t know it was anything different. Through different friends and family, it was just kind of a thing we watched and then when I was in my tweens and teen years then I just discovered ‘oh my gosh this is a big thing!’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What got you interested in cosplaying?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: “I’ve been coming to anime fest in Wichita for seven years now. And I&#8217;ve actually been making costumes and sewing since I was 6 and 7. I’ve actually been making costumes way before I had my realization about anime, but when I found out that I can have both of them together I just started sewing costumes and eventually I started competing in competitions.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: Have you been to other conventions other than the one in Wichita?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “I’ve been to ton of cons in the US. Not lots of big ones but I&#8217;ve started to expand a bit more.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What inspired your costume?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A: “I actually made every single piece of this. I pattered all of these &nbsp;[pieces of] clothing by myself. I do not use any store bought patterns. I do all of the sizing from scratch and, this whole prop and everything, I built myself.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This actually has a manga and an anime, its actually quite old. It’s called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardcaptor Sakura</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it’s one of the original, magical girl series. It’s kind of around the same age as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sailor Moon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;.Kind of like in the 90s.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: What&#8217;s your favorite anime? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>A:&nbsp;“I don’t think I have a specific favorite show. As far as certain movies, genres, and series that I like, I like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio Ghibli </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movies. Those were one of the first things I watched when I was a kid and they were amazing&#8230;.they’re some of the best parts of my childhood. They’re such inspirational, sweet, adventurous movies. It’s always amazing.” </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her costume took her nine hours and three evenings to make. Most of her costumes take longer than that, but this specific costume (as shown in the photo) was one of her most simple ones. She has multiple versions of the same character, therefore reusing the same wig and prop. </span></li>

I just come, mainly, to see all my friends that I, honestly, have through cosplay and whatnot. I just come to hang out and everything. I haven&#8217;t been doing any cosplay here in the last couple of years just because I&#8217;ve been working on other stuff. I used to be pretty big into it.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Have you been to other conventions other than the one in Wichita? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong>A:&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Naka-kon, Nep-con up in Nebraska which I&#8217;ve also been to quite often.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the incline of discriminatory acts that have occurred after the announcement of the new president of the United states, a few Northwest students decided to hold a protest, or peace rally as participants like to identify , before school on the 14th of November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t really like the term ‘protest’. We used the word ‘peace rally’ because protest just has a lot of negative connotations,” said junior Hailey Colborn. “It was a rally for unity, positivity and peace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside many others, Colborn doesn&#8217;t understand why the rally received backlash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[People] should understand an event before [they] automatically take a stance,” said Colborn. “Because if they would&#8217;ve listened, the only thing we were trying to do was promote equality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colborn even claims that while some parents honked at them for support, others flipped them off while being visibly annoyed. Junior Emerson Ross was also a participate of the peace rally that supported the idea of spreading equality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was basically something to show people that everyone should learn to love each other and not hate,” said Ross. “Although we are minors and we can&#8217;t vote, we are still affected by discrimination and we are showing [others] that we do have a voice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He too does not understand why the rally, that was suppose to promote peace, received negative comments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It didn&#8217;t make sense, because if you don&#8217;t like a protest against discrimination that&#8217;s basically saying that you are for discrimination and that&#8217;s terrible,” said Ross. “Why would you want to belittle someone over the way that they are, over the way they’re born?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Keaton Fish states that he is ‘not against a group of students standing up for what they believe in’ but does believe that the peace rally was slightly inappropriate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Driving into the school and seeing all those people, just knowing that it was more about the election than what they would like to say it was,” said Fish. “It kinda felt like they were trying to call us out and say that we were racist or homophobic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes that the protest date was ‘conveniently’ right after the election and that the protestors should have postponed the rally until the drama revolving around President elect Donald Trump died down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they would&#8217;ve waited I, myself, would&#8217;ve gladly stood out there with them and supported [their cause],” said Fish. “But because of what has been going on at the same time, it felt more like it was an attack politically than it was a standup for peace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fish turned 18 during the spring and took the opportunity to vote for Donald Trump. And although Colborn was an organizer of the peace rally she claims to not have a stance against either presidential candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not taking like a pro-trump or anti-trump stance on anything,” said Colborn. “Quite frankly, I don&#8217;t even know what party I&#8217;m in because I’m only 16 years old.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the peace rally did receive some objection, so have a few Trump supporters. “[Donald Trump] has made very racist comments, he has made very sexist comments,” admitted Fish. “But because I don&#8217;t agree with what [Hillary Clinton] was saying, people automatically think that the words that he said came out of my mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many students who are Trump supporters still believe that this peace rally was more of a political protest than what the participants would like to admit. While on the other hand, protesters believe that they were just showing everyone to spread love not hate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the question if Ross would participate in future rallies he says,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fight&#8217;s not over in ending discrimination. And until that fight is over, I want to make sure that I&#8217;m a part of that fight to spread love.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of media attention upon race issues have sprung up within the years of 2015-2016. Great controversy has risen with the Sandra Bland case, the Baltimore riots, police brutality, and the heated debate of “Black lives matter” against “All lives matter”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phrase “‘Black lives matter’ is mirrored, distorted, refuted and mocked by the phrase ‘All lives matter’”, as said in an article published by </span><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/23/all-lives-matter-racist-trump-weekend-campaign-rally-proved-it"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in November 2015. The original phrase was introduced to society in 2013 after 28-year-old neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman was found not guilty for the death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in a gated housing community in Florida. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article also explains how the controversy of the two phrases caused violence at the Donald Trump rally in Alabama with a black protester being beaten and dragged from the rally due to chanting ‘All black lives matter’ to the ‘All lives matter’ participants of the rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But all of these issues seem to be involving African Americans only. Before the remarks that Donald Trump made about Mexicans, no one seemed to be interested about the racist issues within the Hispanic community. All black lives do matter, but what about all latino lives? In 2014, Salinas, Calif.  was in unrest after protesters accused police of racism in the fatal shooting of three Latino men, then in May after another Latino man was shot to death outside his home, as reported on </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/22/us/california-protest-police-shooting-hispanics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Four days before Halloween in 2015, the police shot and killed unarmed Oscar Jr., a 28 year old Hispanic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither the media or society seem to care about the stereotypes, racial slurs, and police brutality inflicted upon the hispanic community.  A </span><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-0718-latino-police-20150718-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article written in July of last year state that, “The muted reaction towards to the deaths of latinos in confrontations with the police tells a larger story: Black Lives Matter is starkly different from Brown Lives Matter….In contrast to the fatal shootings of African Americans…. Deaths of latinos at the hand of law enforcement haven&#8217;t drawn as nearly as much attention.” The majority of people can tell you who Sandra Bland is but not who Antonio Zambrano-Montes is; an unarmed immigrant who was shot and killed by the police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racism has always existed, and always will. But as a nation, we should be working together to decrease racism not with just one race, but with all races. My thoughts and opinions cannot be more well said as how Raul Reyes said in his article </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/opinions/reyes-antonio-zambrano-montes/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doesn’t life of Latino shot by police matter?</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until we know the real statistics, how can we expect real outrage? Latinos bear our own share of responsibility for not putting greater value on Latino lives.”</span></p>
<p><b>Holding Cells</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hispanics are often attacked with racism due to their skin color, culture, or ‘immigration background’.  They are also outright prejudiced against due to the stereotype of an immigrant who is stealing American jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of immigrants in the United States is and could become a huge problem with 11, 714,500 immigrants residing in America. But the way deported immigrants are treated should improve. During the process of deportation, immigrants are sent to holding cells. Each year, the cells hold thousands of people near the southern border that are often reported as extremely cold, overcrowded, and usually lacking in adequate food, water, and medical care. These holding cells were originally meant to detain a person for less than 12 hours, but over 80 percent of people detained are there for over 24 hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 80 percent includes men, women, and children. Children are forced to sleep on concrete floors or on hard benches within the holding cells that replace the lack of beds. Statistics show that nearly 8,000 people were held in the concrete cells for three days or longer, while another 25,000 were held for 48 hours or longer. “Immigrants were denied water, and when they did get it, it was almost undrinkable,&#8221; said Ray Stern in his article </span><a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/immigrants-caught-at-border-mistreated-in-holding-cells-lawsuit-says-7401983"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrants caught at border mistreated in holding cells, Lawsuit says.</span></i></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if its is for short period of time, living under such unsanitary and uncomfortable conditions can affect a person mentally. Such conditions can be compared to those of a prison. The majority of immigrants are going through a major change in their lives physically, mentally, and spiritually. They are searching for a way to change their lives for the better. And to be treated as a prisoner is outright humiliating. Conditions of these detention facilities should improve for the case of the families and children who are being deported. People should not be treated in such way especially if they have done nothing wrong. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many area high schools came to Northwest to participate in a forensics competition on March 29. In this competition, participants could choose to partake in a mock student congress or in a script of their choosing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stakes are high in this competition, as only two students per district in each event can go to Nationals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can be really hard there are a lot of really strong speakers, like the people who get presidential scholarships,” Maize South competitor Jessica Tongue said. “This is also one of the things where you can go to state or nationals, but if you want to go to nationals it’s very hard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forensics is a semester class at Northwest. It is a mixture of debate, drama, and speech where a student can choose to learn about all three skills or just one. Senior Whitney Clum,who helped host the competition Tuesday,  sees forensics as a skill that has helped her organize her thoughts and become a better public speaker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some people do sports every week, some people do choir practice; I do forensics and debate,” Clum said. “It&#8217;s something that I do every single weekend. I go home [and] I practice. It’s just like any other thing; you&#8217;re only as good as you really want to be and how much you practice.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forensics also teaches students how to appeal to different kinds of people and how to become more persuasive. Said skills may be an advantage when it comes to a college or job interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can just come across as very well spoken no matter who or what it is,” Clum said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the infamous Kansas education budget cuts, Forensics may be the next target. Tongue stated that she believes Maize is not planning on eliminating forensics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of schools are cutting it, but hopefully those schools will still offer it as an afterschool activity because it&#8217;s important,” Tongue said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forensics tournaments are unique in the sense that competitors are independent in their performances, which causes a more difficult yet friendly competition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[There’s] such a friendly attitude,” Clum said. “With Northwest it’s even better because our old coach is married to the Curtis High coach. For a while there we would take car trips together and we still had a pretty close relationship. But the majority of the people in forensics are really nice people.” </span></p>
<p>Forensics is often compared to debate due to the overlapping of teams, but they are separate competitions with significant differences. Clum compares the two to Obama and Putin shaking hands.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere and efforts made by the participants of the two competitions are also different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Debate is so intense and you’re face to face arguing,” Clum said. “In forensics you’re not even seeing the person you’re competing against. There&#8217;s nothing you can do other than your own individual performance to outdo anyone else.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1978, the home of the Grizzlies has undergone minor and major changes. Northwest High School has had its doors open for the past 38 years and has had developments in the academics, scheduling, and construction of the building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English teacher Ann Burgett has been a part of the Northwest faculty for 23 years after taking some time off in 2008, and has witnessed the change of the school first-hand. Burgett also taught when the school did not have a block schedule. She said that the classes were 50 minutes long and students received a larger workload. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we got a lot done in that time period, because you saw those kids every single day,” Burgett said. “So I felt like I expected a lot more from them because they knew the next day what was going on and we didn’t have to go back and re-teach anything.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burgett also said the curriculum has not changed dramatically throughout the years and that Northwest has always been focused on preparing students for college readiness. Even though she has been through the many different tardy policies and teaching styles, the most noticeable change for her was the construction of the building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s been a lot of add-ons to the school,” Burgett said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to principal Gil Alvarez, the new additions of the school has added approximately 58,000 square feet onto the building. Northwest is approximately 308,341 square feet of building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything must develop with time, and the school is no exception. As the years have gone by, the school has become more modernized. Burgett explains how the school slowly gained and obtained computers, overheads, PowerPoints, and Smart Boards, and how these items have affected the students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Technology helps make kids expect more because without the technology they would have to be creative in different ways,” Burgett said. “With technology it’s easier to be creative with doing certain things. I think that makes a big difference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business teacher Georgia Rovenstine, has also been working at Northwest for over a decade. She has seen changes in technology, but said that the social patterns of students are still the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Rovenstine has been a teacher at Northwest since 1997, she has also seen minor changes in not only the students, but also in the parents in their opinion of ways of teaching. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rovenstine has also noticed specific rules that have changed, similar to Burgett. The advancement Rovenstine noticed more was cellphones, since they weren’t as used as much 20 years ago as they are now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents have a harder time supporting the cell phone policy because they want to get a hold of their kids,” Rovenstine said. “So we see less parent support because they don’t really understand the principle or reasoning behind it themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also describes the similarities and differences in the choice of clothing style of students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t have a cleavage problem because the clothing style has changed,” Rovenstine said. “There’s less clothing on the top and bottom. There [were] also no yoga pants. I went to school in the 70s and it was the same in the 70s because the style was halter tops, the shorts were very short, and mini skirts were around.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burgett and Rovenstine share the same opinion about how students had more of a workload in the past years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[The] classes I teach are computer classes, so if kids couldn’t get the work done they had to come in after class anyway because they still didn’t have the software,” Rovenstine said. “Math has got a pretty good homework load now, but I don’t think there’s more homework now than what there was at that point.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Burgett, even though Northwest has gone through major developments since 1978, it still has the same core and goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[We] still have high expectations which Northwest has always asked for,” Burgett said. “They ask for excellence and that’s what they expect from the students and that’s what the rules stand by.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Samantha Gould, junior from Andale</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q: How did Andale perceive and stereotype Northwest?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was geared more toward all Wichita schools. They just called people ghetto and a lot of different stuff. There was a lot of racist people, so they called them other things.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q: Now that you’re attending Northwest has your perspective of the school changed?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My cousin goes here, so I&#8217;ve heard good things about it. I came into the school already liking it.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Rebecca Faelberg, junior from South</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q: What school did you transfer from?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve actually transferred from two schools. Last year I went to Buhler which is near Hutch, and the year before that I went to South.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q: How did South High students perceive and stereotype Northwest?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was more like, ‘Northwest is a preppy school.’ Going from South to here is really different, because it’s a little more preppy but not like ‘Oh it’s so preppy!’ It’s not that different.” </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q: Has your perspective changed a little bit since you&#8217;ve transferred to Northwest?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I originally didn&#8217;t want to come here because I was really scared that I would just not fit in because it’s just a different school. But I&#8217;ve made a lot of friends and I get along a little bit with everyone.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q: Do you think that Northwest falls into the stereotype?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just a little bit but not completely. It’s not as preppy as people would think it is, it&#8217;s fun and not as judgmental but it&#8217;s also not perfect. There are still fights; I’ve seen more fights here than at South.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Daytrell Nash, sophomore from West</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q: How did West High students perceive Northwest?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They said that it was just a preppy school and uptight.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q: What’s the biggest difference between the two schools?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just the size of the two schools and the environment.”</span></p>
