										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Northwest students participated in State DECA Competitions in Kansas City on Mar. 3.</p>
<p dir="ltr">28 Northwest students placed in the top 10 in their events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The students competed in one of three different areas,” said business teacher Jeff Darr. These areas include role play, written tests, and presenting their projects that were being worked on throughout the year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Juniors Marshall Johnson was elected as Kansas DECA reporter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ve done better this year,” said Johnson. “You get to up your skills in the business world.” Johnson placed third in Entrepreneurship Innovation Plan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Marissa Haugen placed 10th in Apparel and Accessories, second in Creative Marketing Project, and was elected as Central Region Vice-President.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I didn’t have any free time this time, so it was really hectic, and kinda scary, and nerve wracking,” said Haugen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The next thing students will start to prepare for is the International DECA Career Development Conference in Atlanta, Georgia on May 3-7.</p>
<p>“It’s not the regular ‘nerd program’,” said Johnson, “it’s more fun, people are laid back, they’re kids like you are. You get to meet new people, it’s cool.”</p>
