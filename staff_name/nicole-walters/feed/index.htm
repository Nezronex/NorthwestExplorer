										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest opened its new gym and hosted its first game on Jan. 19 against West. The updated gym has created many changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have some more space for cheerleading or other teams to practice on the upper deck behind the bleachers, brighter, nicer, it’ll hold more people,” athletic director Lance Deckinger said. “The new track makes it good for all P.E. classes, place for teams to workout with.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Northwest gym has many benefits to athletes, students, and teachers alike, including more space for students. Now the athletes can practice at the same time in the different gyms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before we couldn&#8217;t practice at the same time as the boys so our practices were longer,” sophomore Lucy Herter said. Now we can leave way earlier.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The athletic teachers have had to adjust to construction and now moving between the old and new gym but even they have no complaints as the gym is finally accessible.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It affected all of us, but in education you have to be flexible, patient, you have to roll with what happens and we did a good job with that,” gym teacher Jim Mernaugh said. “We get to spread out, we can have one class in the old gym and one in the new gym, another class in the weight room, and the more space. The new gym is beautiful.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the gym is being used, it is still not entirely finished yet because the old gym is still being transformed into a new weights room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gym’s not finished yet,” Deckinger said. “All the things aren&#8217;t done in it, but we’re playing in it right now. Everything at Northwest High school should be done by June.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Northwest wrestling team finished the regular season unbeaten in every dual. To top it off, the wrestlers won the City League tournament.   </p>
<p>They have continued an impressive winning streak for the past four years thanks not only to the athletes, but also to the coaches like Eric Prichard.</p>
<p>“We have good kids but also the coaching staff has been coaching together for 20 years which helps with consistency and leadership,” Prichard said.</p>
<p>The wrestling team has been consistently winning their duals and hope to continue the winning streak.</p>
<p>“We have won our 48th straight dual in a row which goes back four years,” Prichard said.</p>
<p>Both the JV and Varsity wrestling teams won the championship at the City League Tournament Saturday, Feb. 14th. </p>
<p>“It was a great feeling winning individually and as a team,” senior Saul Ortiz said.  “We proved that we were the best.”</p>
<p>The state wrestling tournament takes place Saturday, Feb. 28th at Hartman Arena. </p>
<p>“I’m excited for state and showing people what we can do,” Ortiz said.</p>
<p>Their success has depended not just on physical strength but also the mental strength of a person during a match.</p>
<p>“Its just you out there and that’s hard,” Prichard said. “Whether you win or lose is totally on you and that’s tough.”</p>
<p>Senior Matt Washee understands just how hard it is to give your all physically and mentally.</p>
<p>“The hardest part is fighting through the mental part of wrestling and being mentally tough,” Washee said.</p>
<p>The real key to the Grizzlies’ success, however, is the teamwork and effort they invest.</p>
<p>“We as a team work hard and push each other,” Washee said.</p>
