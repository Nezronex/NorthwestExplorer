										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The day: Tuesday December 7, 2010. The event: World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. I waited in line at 11:30 ready to pick up my new game. I was surprised by what the crowd looked like. The common idea is that the people would be nerdy. But I saw a wide range of people from a 63 year old woman, to several moms and dads.</p>
<p>But all of this was ignored when I picked up my game at 12:01 and rushed home. By 12:30 I had the game installed and was online but did not realize that the game was not online until 2 am.</p>
<p>I turned off the game and watched Final Destination. Didn’t expect me to say that huh? Hah!</p>
<p>As soon as the clock ticked to 1:55, I skipped the ending of the movie, which was probably pretty predictable, and jumped back online.</p>
<p>The change was extremely over hyped. At 2 o’clock nothing happened. I thought for a while that I had been tricked until I saw players riding gryphons through the capital city of Stormwind. And I knew then that the time had finally come.</p>
<p>I logged out to create a new worgen which is like a werewolf but with control on when and where they transform.</p>
<p>I customize the hair and the eyes and the beard, all of which seem pointless on this 9 foot monster, and hop right into the game. I pop up and am instantly surrounded by hundreds of other people around the world trying to make this new and interesting character.</p>
<p>I run to kill a small critter and when I am feet from destroying him, five other worgen players crush my target. Since this is one of the new quests I figure many players will be crowding the zone for weeks to come.</p>
<p>I start my new plan by creating a Deathknight worgen. Since the Deathknights have their own zone, I encounter only a few other players. I greatly enjoyed my time morphing from human to worgen and worgen to human. Or running around on all fours and racing around at the speed of other players on their horse.</p>
<p>At first, I was hesitant about a fourth game, but all in all I am impressed with the new expansion and am excited to continue playing. However I have a piece of advice, do not try to make a worgen named Jacob… It has already been done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Tom Sawyer, The Catcher in the Rye, Huckleberry Finn, </em>these books sound familiar? They should, they are all on the USD 259 reading list. However these books are still controversial and in some places and times, banned. Here at Northwest High, the sophomores in Mrs. Priebe’s English class are discovering why.</p>
<p>“The project was to get the kids to read some classics that were banned at one point,” Priebe said. “They were to make journals and investigate as to why they were banned.”</p>
<p>Some of the times books are banned purely based on the title. Works such as <em>The Naked and the Dead</em>, which was a book about World War II, are banned simply because the name appears profane.</p>
<p>Sophomore Gabbi Hardiman read <em>Of Mice and Men</em>. “I thought it was a good book, but has some racist and some vulgar language,” Hardiman said.</p>
<p>Priebe requested the students read books that were banned as somewhat of a challenge, but also because this is somewhat of a personal subject. “My mother wouldn’t let me read ‘Go Ask Alice’ when I was in high school,” Mrs. Priebe said.</p>
<p><em>Go Ask Alice </em>is a book that was controversial at the time. It is about a teenage girl that became addicted to drugs but that holds an anti-drug stand.</p>
<p>“I was happy to get a lot of positive feedback,” Priebe said, “During conferences, parents said they enjoyed discussing the banned books with their children.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Pull out another sheet of paper to add to your notebook,” math teacher Sarah Gegen says.</p>
<p>More and more students are hearing this from their teachers. But the teachers are not trying to annoy you, they are just trying to save the precious little money the school has.</p>
<p>“The school’s budget is no secret,” principal Karen Pickert said, “and so it’s no secret that we have been cutting back on spending due to the decrease in funding. A decrease of approximately $3000 from last year alone.”</p>
<p>“Due to the regulations of the Kansas State Department of Education, our commissions on vending machines has dropped drastically,” Pickert explains “We had already experienced a decrease of around $20,000 over the last 10 years and with the new guidelines, it will probably continue to decline.”</p>
<p>These cuts don’t only affect students; the food served at meetings, student events and faculty in-services has also been cut.</p>
<p>Cutting back on paper is an easy way to save money for more important resources for the school. Since paper has gone up $6.44/carton in the last five years, which makes it $26.19 a carton, paper usage seems to be an easy thing to monitor.</p>
<p>“Last year, in the first week of March, 60,000 sheets were run through our small copiers, 12 cartons of paper,” Pickert said.</p>
<p>Teachers can help to fix this problem, and one of these ways is demonstrated by science teacher Carl Hinote. Hinote has come up with a notebook idea in which students can go online and print it themselves, pay for the printing cost from the school or make their own notebook with a three ring binder.</p>
<p>“Not only does this save money for the school, but it’s an easier way for me to get them the information and help them stay organized,” Hinote said.</p>
<p>“We also monitor the use of custodial supplies very carefully,” Pickert said, “but one of the largest cutbacks has come from energy. The entire building was not air conditioned during the summer and was shut down for 3 days every week.”</p>
