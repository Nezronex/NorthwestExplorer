										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Junior Alex East sits at his computer surfing the web. He’s not on Facebook or Twitter like most other teens, instead he’s on sites like kake.com and kwch.com searching for recent stories on his favorite, now closed theme park, Joyland.</p>
<p>“Nothing has come up recently but every story that I do read, I go to the comments and there’s always like 80 to 160 comments from people about how they want to get together as a city and raise money and go in and fix it and reopen it someday,” East Said. “I’ve always wondered why no one has taken that initiative and pushed the idea further than just the text. So basically the idea is just a big fundraiser throughout the city and maybe some private corporations to buy the park, refurbish it and reopen it in late 2012 or early 2013.”</p>
<p>A while back East tried to circulate a petition to reopen Joyland but soon learned that a petition would do no good. When the park owners have no money there is nothing that can be done without the city’s help. Joyland is a very significant symbol in East’s life. It means more to him than just simple worn down rides. He wouldn’t be the person he is today if not for that amusement park.</p>
<p>“Joyland is the driving force behind the reason I want to design rides. I rode that rollercoaster at Joyland when I was two and ever since then, I’ve been into amusement parks. So I know my story behind it and I know that a lot of other people in the city have emotional attachments to it as well, since they grew up with it over the years,” East said.</p>
<p>Ever since that first ride on a roller coaster when he was two, East has been fascinated with them, especially their design. Supported by his friends and family, East dreams of becoming an engineer and wants to eventually build the roller coasters he is designing.</p>
<p>“I plan on going to K-State and studying architectural engineering and then eventually after that I would probably go up to the Philadelphia Toboggan Company; they design roller coasters and stuff like that,” East said.</p>
<p>For others wanting to follow in East’s footsteps, here’s his advice.</p>
<p>“Do really well in math because it’s a lot of math. I don’t like math, but you need to work on math,” East said.</p>
<p>But studying math isn’t the only thing that East does in his free time, he loves to build roller coasters.</p>
<p>“I like to know how things work so I can build them from my perspective,” East said.</p>
<p>His knowledge on how things work and his drive to build things has focused on roller coasters from a young age.</p>
<p>“I didn’t build the first one I got. My parents bought me a mini Ferris Wheel when I was two,” East said. “When I could start building things I picked it up.”</p>
<p>Throughout the years East has accumulated about 6800 K’Nex through birthdays and other holidays. This led to the creation of a model roller coaster that has given him some attention. Taking about 5 days to build, this model is more then a simple hobby.</p>
<p>“It’s been on TV twice and shown in the event at Exploration Place,” East said. “When it was on TV in 2008, the people from Exploration Place saw it and contacted me.”</p>
<p>Even though his model roller coaster has gained him attention he still has one big goal in mind.</p>
<p>“If I could accomplish one thing in my life it would be to reopen Joyland,” East said. “It’s a place easy to call home.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s mid-November and I go online to my favorite store’s website only to see a huge Christmas ad dominating the main page. It is way too early to be pushing Christmas deals. Two years ago I rushed out at 4 a.m. to Old Navy on Black Friday, just to wait in line and get a free MP3 player with my purchase.  Although some people think it’s crazy, for me it was fun and the highlight of my Thanksgiving break. Economy troubles are forcing CEOs to push Black Friday deals super early to protect their bottom line. With millions of people out of work, Christmas spending is bound to decrease this year.</p>
<p>But what does this mean for the actual ‘Black Friday’? Will people still wake up at 4 a.m. and trample each other, just to get the cheapest flat screen? Stores like Walmart and Sears are claiming huge deals all the way through Christmas. With slogans like “Amazing Online Specials,” and “Cyber Monday Now,” the pressure is on to get the gifts.</p>
<p>But are these deals as good as they claim to be? According to Amazon.com, the list price for a 47 inch Phillips 1080p LCD television is $1300 and Walmart is listing that same TV at $719. Other hot gifts this year, like the Kinect for Xbox 360, are expected to be on many peoples wish lists. The Xbox 360 4GB console with a kinect and three games is being sold at Walmart for only $388. These are just the everyday deals.</p>
<p>Consumers expected even bigger deals on the real Black Friday, but with deals this good why would anyone be crazy enough to go stand out in the freezing morning air?  And what about the smaller businesses who can’t compete with Corporate America? Most family businesses just don’t have the resources to offer those deals. It is sad to see family businesses fail next to Walmart, Sears and Best Buy.</p>
<p>With Christmas spending such a big deal, it feels like people are losing sight about what the holiday really means. Instead of hanging decorations on the tree while listening to Christmas tunes, everyone is getting in their car and rushing to the stores to get the best deals.</p>
<p>A week before Thanksgiving break I went to Walmart to get some groceries and people were swarming the electronics section as if they would die if they didn’t get that new TV or video game. It is the beginning of the holiday season but for the past month, everywhere you looked, there was Christmas. So instead of getting all the insane shopping done at once, we now have to suffer through a full month of crazy Christmas shoppers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s past midnight. You walk as quietly as possible, trying to hear any sound that warns you that you’re not alone. You know something is coming, but you just don’t know what or when it will happen. You’re heart is pounding, your body is trembling and you can feel the adrenaline running through you’re veins. This is what you waited in an epically long line for.</p>
<p>It’s none other than Field of Screams, and if you manage to make it through and pay attention to your surroundings then you just might recognize some of the actors. Junior Nicole Dohrman and senior Joey Williams are two of the actors at Field of Screams.</p>
<p>“It’s fun, a great working environment, great people and good pay,” Williams said.</p>
<p>Williams and Dohrman have both worked at Field of Screams for 2 years. They work on weekends so the late nights don’t affect their school work. Jumping around, screaming, and consuming energy drinks help to keep them awake in the late hours. But with a job like theirs, there is bound to be some danger.</p>
<p>“Someone has injured me by running over me, knocking me down,” Dohrman said.</p>
<p>People go to Field of Screams to get scared but some don’t handle the terror as well as others. For some people, their first reaction is to fight back.</p>
<p>“I have been kneed, punched, kicked, slapped, tackled, and head butted,” Williams said.</p>
<p>But even with the occupational hazards of the job the actors still love it.</p>
<p>“[My favorite thing is] being able to be somebody else that you’re not,” Dohrman said.</p>
<p>While there are hazards for the actors there is sometimes danger for terrified patrons. When they say don’t run and watch where you walk, they mean it.</p>
<p>“I scared a group and they all ran towards the front and one by one they fell down the stairs, piling up at the bottom, I couldn’t stop them because they were screaming to loud,” Williams said.</p>
<p>Field of screams is arguably one of the best horror attractions in Wichita, with thousands of people attending every weekend during the Halloween season. But even the professionals can get creped out.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, because of the atmosphere, you think you see things but you don’t,” Dohrman said.</p>
<p>The ticket sales for Field of Screams go on until 11:30 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. That means shifts go until early morning and once the field is closed the eerie silence can be frightening.</p>
<p>“I left my keys on the bus and walked back to the front, then realized everybody was out of the field, so it was pretty creepy walking through it alone at 2 am,” Williams said.</p>
<p>To work at Field of Screams you have to apply and audition. Auditions are held at Prairie Pines in late July. For more information about Field of Screams visit scaryprairiepines.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holly Berenson, played by Katherine Heigl, is a single, orderly, and slightly uptight bakery owner who gets sent on a blind date with a complete nincompoop named Eric Messer, played by Josh Duhamel. After he arrives an hour late, forgets to make a restaurant reservation, and answers a booty call right in front of her, she gives up on the date.</p>
<p>She calls her best friend Alison Novak, played by Christina Hendricks, and says the only way she could make it up to her was that she would never have to see him again. But sadly she has to see a lot more of him when their mutual best friends get married.</p>
<p>Holly has a successful bakery with dreams to expand and has met a guy named Sam who comes in everyday to buy the same exact sandwich. Messer’s job is directing cameras for a basketball team and spends his free time hooking up with as many girls as possible.</p>
<p>One night Holly and Messer get called down to the police station and learn that their best friends, Allison and Peter Novak, were killed in a car crash when their vehicle flipped. Holly and Messer spend the night at the Novak home and the next morning they pick up their 1-year-old daughter Sophie from child services. Sophie was played by Alexis, Brynn, and Brooke Clagett. When the Novak’s lawyer goes over the will with Holly and Messer they are shocked to find that they have both been named as the guardians of Sophie.</p>
<p>In an attempt to make it work, they move into the Novak’s home and raise Sophie. Things go along fine with only a few arguments until one night when they get stoned and decide to “complicate” their relationship.</p>
<p>Before they know it Holly is expanding her restaurant and Messer gets a job opportunity from the phoenix Suns. After a huge fight with Messer, he decides to take the job and leaves. Holly tries to move on and starts dating Sam, played by Josh Lucas. But sometimes it’s hard to let go of the past.</p>
<p><em> Life as we know it </em>is definitely a romantic comedy. It is the best love story I have seen since Letters to Juliet and will have you laughing throughout the movie. Holly and Messer’s complicated relationship and dysfunctional family is touching and easy to relate to.</p>
<p>The movie makes you feel like you really know the characters. Although Holly is meticulous and Messer is a jerk, audiences will end up loving them in the end. Although it came in second in box office sales for their opening weekend, <em>Life as We Know It</em> is definitely a movie to check out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Vampire spoof of the Twilight Saga had twi-hards and twi-haters buzzing all over the internet. With attractive cast members and almost identical scenes, this movie cashed in on the Twilight pandemonium, making $20 million on its opening weekend.</p>
<p>Directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are known for releasing not-so original movies, but they knocked it out of the park with this flick. Whether you like Twilight or not, this movie is hilarious. It is the first spoof I’ve seen that actually held my interest, probably because of my insane love for everything Twilight.</p>
<p>Becca Crane, played by Jenn Proske, was a normal teenage girl who moves to Sporks, Washington and ends up falling in love with a make-up wearing, hair curling, stylish dressing, sparkling Vampire named Edward Sullen, played by Matt Lanter.</p>
<p>The Chihuahua transforming, cat chasing, Jacob White is played by Chris Riggi, who is shirtless the majority of the movie. But with a body like his, I’m not complaining. This movie takes scenes from the first two books in the saga and made fun of them in every possible way they could.</p>
<p>The movie jumps around a bit and the plot doesn’t flow as well as it could. A lot of time is spent poking fun at teenage emotions and experiences like hard break ups and drinking at prom.</p>
<p>All the actors and actresses played teenagers, even though I doubt they are under 20.With some violence and slight sexual references, this movie had comedy for a more mature audience. ­­­</p>
<p>From a dancing pack of werewolves in short shorts to Edward stripping down at prom to nothing but a big shiny disco ball, this movie had the whole theatre laughing. This generation’s obsession with vampires has lead to a new era in literature and movies. So with everything promoting the new view of vampires, there needs to be one good movie making fun of it. If you haven’t seen this movie yet then you better check it out while it’s still on the big screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sophomore Brian Taylor high fives his teammates quickly after zooming across the finish line. And no, this isn’t NASCAR, but Taylor just stole the victory for longest distance in the physic’s longest distance challenge.</p>
<p>“If you’ve ever read the ugly duckling, it was very similar. No one expected it to go the farthest. They pointed and laughed but we knew deep down that it’s what’s on the inside that counts,” junior Brian Taylor said after his group’s not so attractive car won farthest distance.</p>
<p>Physics students built cars out of various materials that are powered by a single rubber band and then graph the displacement, velocity and acceleration.</p>
<p>“It’s fun and frustrating,” physics teacher Lynda Snyder said about her classes’ recent rubber band car experiment. “Students have to work together and think ‘outside the box’ to create a working, beautiful car.”</p>
<p>The class was divided into groups of four and each group brought in materials to build and decorate a car. But for some students their favorite part of the lab was racing their car against their classmates. Cars were pitted against each other in attempt to win fastest car, farthest distance and a variety of other categories, including best design.</p>
<p>Junior Thalia Fenton’s group built the car using two sizes of Quick Trip lids, a water bottle, wooden sticks, straws and a rubber band.</p>
<p>“We hole punched the bottle to poke the axels through then hot glued the wheels,” Fenton said.</p>
<p>The goal of this experiment was to learn about acceleration. After the competitions were over it was time to get to work. Students had to record and graph the acceleration of their car.</p>
<p>“Our car accelerated pretty fast and then it would back up a little before stopping,” junior Nicole Dohrman said. “Our car was simple compared to others, but it was lighter in weight so it was faster.”</p>
<p>“[Students learn] a little about designing, force, friction, stability, a lot about patience and perseverance,” Snyder said. “They can see how the car moves and relate that to their calculations and graphs.”</p>
<p>Some other cars included a Sunny Delight bottle with a cape made by junior Olivia Resch, junior Morganne Wiltse and their group and junior Cayla West’s group a car made only with things found in the classroom.</p>
