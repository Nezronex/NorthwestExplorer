										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">There was a lot of fishy activity going around the halls of Northwest April 1. Fish began appearing on people’s backs almost like an epidemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The French classes every year celebrate April Fools by cutting out fishes with the words “poisson d’avril” written on them, and then taping them to unsuspecting victims’ backs. Poisson d’avril in translation simply means the fish of April.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I love celebrating this way,” said freshman Ben Johnson, “because I got to stick a fish to someone’s back, and then I would say ‘I fished them in the back.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">This French tradition is very prominent in France and mostly only played by school children.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No one really know as to why or how it became such a big tradition in France, but there have been many theories of how it may have come to be.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One theory says that they do this because in 1582, after the Gregorian Christian Calendar was created, people who still continued to celebrate New Years on April 1 rather than January 1 were mocked as “fools” or “fish.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other theorist thought that maybe it had something to do with Lent, but no one exactly knows how it started; it just kind of caught on and everyone started doing it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“A lot of April Fool’s Day jokes play with people’s emotions,” said French teacher Lisa Devore, “So I like to celebrate April Fools Day this way, because I find it a cute, silly way that’s not hurtful.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A lot of students have been wondering if they can take courses over the summer to get ahead or to just simply catch up, and the long awaited answer is no; not technically.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A student can take financial literacy the summer before their junior year and they can take Government the summer before senior year, otherwise there are no other courses available to be taken over the summer to get ahead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Summer school is only for the purpose of taking a class that has been failed,” said sophomore counselor Scott Cathey.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cost is expected to be $90.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There will be announcements over this matter discussing all of the students’ options and will give them specific information within the next month or so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to apply for summer school, students will have to come by the counseling office to get an application and should return the application with the payment as soon as possible to their class counselor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The matter of taking classes outside of USD 259 will generally not be helpful. In order to do so, the student will have to withdraw from the system for a whole semester; so it really is not advised.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The very best way to advance at the quickest pace is to be sure to be successful in all classes,” said Cathey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Drama isn’t just about acting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Drama teacher Richard Lundin takes his Drama 2/3 class to a whole different level. The drama students had to write, memorize, and perform their own original monologues in front of the class.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I liked giving my own perspective and creativity into an art piece,” said sophomore, Kristi Anderson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They performed their monologues Feb. 13, 19, and 21.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There were a variety of dramatic and comedic, but they mostly leaned towards the dramatic side.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Anderson, writing and performing her own personal monologue was an easier task than performing a monologue by an unfamiliar author like the drama students had done earlier that year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I liked bringing my own thoughts into a monologue,” said Anderson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lundin had discussed how they might do a hat draw and have students perform each other’s personal monologues, but after taking a class vote, the majority of the students voted no. Anderson was relieved at this, since she did not want to perform someone else’s monologue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was easier because it was my own work; if it was someone else’s, I’d be kind of worried, because I wouldn’t know how the author would want it portrayed,” said Anderson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most tedious part of the process for Anderson was the brainstorming &#8212; coming up with a solid storyline to environ the monologue around.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was easy when I got an idea and ran with it, but thinking of one was kind of difficult,” said Anderson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The idea of pouring her own thoughts out into a piece and presenting it to room full of peers was extremely nerve racking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anderson’s monologue was written about a mother in a therapy session explaining how she got in a car wreck, and how she had blamed herself for the death of her husband and twin girls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This was not a personal experience for Anderson, but she had based it slightly on her friend who had been in a car accident.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was difficult, because it’s hard getting up there and doing your own stuff,” said Anderson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">She never imagined she’d be teaching. She thought she would become a professional singer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“My dream was to travel and be in music theatre,” said choir teacher Amy Brown.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Brown studied at Arizona State University for her major in music theatre, she was involved in a total of 25 shows. In pursuing her dream in music theatre, she got pregnant and decided it was time to stop performing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Never wanting to give up on her passion for music, she chose to start teaching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She enjoys teaching because teaching to her is like “parts of a team to make a goal.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">During her time at Arizona, she stumbled upon a man who she would later call her husband.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Needless to say, they fell in love, got married, and had kids. At this point Brown realized she should probably settle down and stop performing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown was relentless to quit music theatre all together and made a decision to begin teaching.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown substituted at Wichita State University in 2000 for a while, and then moved on to a more official teaching job at Wilbur Middle School. Brown taught at Wilbur for 6 years and enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ve always loved seeing people grow and change,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After working at Wilbur for quite some time, Brown was offered a job as the choir teacher for Northwest High School; she accepted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No matter what life threw at her, she could never drift from her musical habits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So here she is now, her tenth year teaching for USD 259, inspiring her kids everyday and being inspired herself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There’s this amazing thing where people think they can’t do it, then you work with them and they do it,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown loves teaching at Northwest and is always looking for ways to make each choir just a little bit better.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We can do stuff at a professional level,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though teaching wasn’t her original plan, Brown doesn’t regret her decision.</p>
<p>“Seeing that kid who never thought they could do it, do it. It’s addictive,” Brown said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Internet has pretty much become our number one source of anything. We communicate through our iPhones and smart phones more than we talk to people face to face. The dangers of hacking and identity theft have become so much more relevant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I probably won’t ever be hacked, nothing like that happens to me. Says every person ever.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Social networks are great, sure. They help us connect with old friends, send funny photos, and just be able to talk to friends in the spur of the moment- anywhere, anytime. Having that availability at the tip of our fingers is incredibly convenient, so it is needless to say we use that to our advantage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People are so caught up in the hype of social networks that no one ever reads the terms and policies anymore. We just assume because everyone has an account, it’s safe. So we just freely give our personal information to the company and start snapping those chats, or posting a picture on Instagram with little to no thought about where it’s going or how it’s being used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take Snapchat for instance. Their big seller is the fact that once a picture is sent, it is deleted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“&#8230;making communication between any two parties fleeting, with no record left of the content, within the constraints of modern technology,” said Snapchat on their terms and policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notice the part, “within the constraints of modern technology”. So basically they’re saying that it most likely won’t get deleted. Everything you put on the Internet within “modern technology” is permanently there, you just can’t always see it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So before you accept to a media network’s terms, read between the lines a little, because that’s where all their secrets lie. Don’t think just because you hide something on the Internet it can’t be accessed, because once you put it on there it’s never going to truly go away. There are some insanely genius people out there who hack your “hidden” stuff for a hobby.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you feel a bit on edge when it comes to  a social network’s terms, do some research first. You’d be surprised what you’ll find.</p>
<p>After all, you can find anything on the Internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Many students have turned away from the TV and have started relying on Netflix to watch their favorite TV shows. But what are they watching? After asking around Northwest, here are the results. (Results are listed in no particular order)</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Doctor Who</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a special year for the “Whovians”; Doctor Who is celebrating fifty years of being on the air, making it the longest-running sci-fi series of all time. Doctor Who started in the nineteen-sixties, was cancelled, brought back on the air with a TV movie, and finally rebooted in 2006.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The show follows the adventures of the Doctor, an alien who travels throughout time and space in his TARDIS with his human companions. Full of memorable characters, smart plot lines and moments that make you cry your eyes out, Doctor Who is not only a good show, it is a good story.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Come on, look at me! No plan, no backup, no weapons worth a damn, oh, and something else I don&#8217;t have: anything to lose! So, if you&#8217;re sitting up there in your silly little space ships with all your silly little guns, and you&#8217;ve got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight, just remember who&#8217;s standing in your way! Remember every black day I ever stopped you, and then, and then, do the smart thing! Let somebody else try first. -The 11th Doctor, Season Five: The Pandorica Opens</p>

<p dir="ltr">-Merlin</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it often gets overshadowed by other BBC shows, Merlin was the first show for a very long time to air on a major American TV broadcaster: NBC. Although it ended last Christmas with an amount of viewers to rival Doctor Who, people are still watching it on Netflix. The show puts a twist on the King Arthur Legend: Arthur and Merlin are the same age, and magic is punishable by death in Camelot. Every character changes immensely throughout the series and each has a secret. The relationships are  done tastefully, the plots were excellent, friendship between the characters made the show, and the snappy dialogue set it apart from other medieval shows. The US tagline for the show says it best: Some fight for justice, others fight for power, all fight for Camelot. Personally, out of all the TV shows on this list, Merlin is my favorite.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote:</p>
<p dir="ltr">The love that binds us is more important than the power we wield. -Mordred, Season Five: Arthur’s Bane Part Two</p>

<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Star Trek: TOS</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have not seen this series,  you have been living under a rock. While it was canceled after its third season back in the 60’s, it became a cult classic, resulting in five spin-off TV series, two movies set in an alternate timeline and 10 original movies. The series follows Captain Kirk,  Mr. Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and other memorable crew members of the starship Enterprise as they explore the galaxy and new civilizations. Star Trek has well-formed characters and original plotlines that really make you think- something that really sets it apart. If you have not seen Star Trek, why are you still reading this? Go and catch up on what you have been missing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-Pretty Little Liars</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s getting intense for all those PLL fanatics. A’s identity is close to being  revealed. In this TV drama/ thriller, four friends come together to discover an anonymous enemy who threatens the safety of all their darkest secrets, masking itself as A. Throughout this series, these friends come close to unraveling their best friend Alison DiLarentis&#8217; murder, while on many occasions, they come close to their own demise. Lately, it&#8217;s hard to know who’s telling the truth and who isn&#8217;t, who’s in cahoots with A and who’s not. Secrets are coming out and relationships are being tested, while lines are being crossed and mysteries are bubbling to the surface. This TV mystery definitely keeps you at the edge of your seat. You never know who’s next on A’s list.</p>

<p dir="ltr">-The Walking Dead</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on a comic book series by Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead  follows a group of humans on the run in Georgia after a zombie apocalypse. Something that makes the series unique is that  the The Walking Dead focuses on human nature and portrays it very accurately. It shows a side of people only brought out by the worst of times. Characters develop beautifully if not always the way we want them to, but insanity is made to be beautiful through the story and excellent writing” instead of the cut-zombies-in-two approach. While the show doesn’t exactly have a consistent cast of characters, there are quite a few fan favorites, which says something about the writers: they can consistently come up with good and complex characters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Famous Quote: You are going to beat this world, I know you will. You are smart, and you are strong, and you are so brave, and I love you. You gotta do what&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s so easy to do the wrong thing in this world. So, so, if it feels wrong don&#8217;t do it, alright? If it feels easy don&#8217;t do it, don&#8217;t let this world spoil you. -Lori,  Season Three: Killer Within</p>

<p dir="ltr">-Sherlock</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sherlock is a mini-series based on the short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle.  The series is set in modern-day London, and features the iconic duo of Sherlock Holmes and Captain John Watson chasing criminals, solving cases, getting themselves into the weirdest situations (showing up in Buckingham palace in a bedsheet) and unraveling the mystery that is professor Moriarty. The series is hilarious, there are memorable one-liners, fantastic actors,  incredibly twisted plots and  horrifying season finales. All in all, Sherlock is something that can appeal to anyone and everyone, including me.</p>

<p>After not-so-patient waiting, the second season has finally arrived on Netflix.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Bring on the caffeine, because the PSAT is coming quickly. Make sure you are studied up and ready to go. The test will be Wednesday, Oct. 16.</p>
<p>You will still arrive at school at 8 a.m. but instead of going to your first hour, you will go to your advocacy class. The testing will go on for about two hours, and then you will continue with your regular classes, except the class periods will only last 45 minutes and the schedule will go 5th hour, 7th hour, 1st hour, and then you will end the day with 3rd hour.</p>
<p>The PSAT is a standardized test administered by the College Board and National Merit Scholarship Corporation. The scores from this test determine whether or not students qualify for the National Merit Scholarship Program.</p>
<p>Juniors usually take this test, but sophomores in honors English classes or AVID will take the PSAT as well.</p>
<p>Some seniors are also testing, but they’re testing on the ACT. All other seniors will be in the gym and auditorium for senior activities.</p>
<p>Freshmen will be taking the EXPLORE test in their advocacy class.</p>
<p>All other sophomores who are not in honors or AVID will be taking the PLAN test in their advocacy.</p>
<p>The PSAT focuses on writing skills, critical reading, and mathematics.</p>
<p>This test is mostly multiple choice; however, there are some free-response questions within the math section. Students are almost always allowed to use calculators for the mathematics section of the test.</p>
