										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad moms Christmas&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Netflix&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 2017</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give: 4.5 star</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This movie was funny but also included scenes such as a mom and daughter reconnecting and making their relationship better. This movie shows a more realistic side to Christmas and doesn&#8217;t only show the happy parts like most movies do. I only took .5 off because this isn’t as much as a movie you would watch with little kids.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holidate</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">site: Netflix</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date: 2020</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give:4</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This movie was a cute romantic Christmas movie. It also was funny and had some drama in it. This is not as much of a movie to watch with little kids but it could be good for teenagers and a group of friends to watch together.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;How the Grinch stole Christmas</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Netflix</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date:2000</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give:5</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This is a classic Christmas movie that almost everyone knows and it is a movie I have watched many times and have not gotten sick of. This movie is funny while also having some drama and some thrill. It is good to watch any time around Christmas and can be watched with your whole family.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Christmas story</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Hulu</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date:1983</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give: 5 stars</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: This is just a solid Christmas movie that many people know. It is an original one and is a funny one whereas many new Christmas movies are romantic ones or ones for kids. This movie is something fun to watch with your whole family.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grinch (new one)</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Site: Netflix</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release date:2018</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rating I would give: 3.5 star</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reason: I feel like I would take a star and a half off only because it is a remake of the old one and i don’t find it as good as the old one. I personally like old original movies better but I do think that this movie is better for younger kids. I remember being younger and scared of this movie a little bit so I do think this one is more animated and joyful compared to the old one which is better for younger kids whereas the original Grinch movie is more fun for everyone.&nbsp; </span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although Hulu is a great app to watch your favorite movies and tv shows on, Netflix is the best. Imagine having to only pay one monthly fee to get all the shows and movies on the app ad free vs. having to pay a monthly fee and pay for every other streaming network you may possibly want for non-ad free movies and tv shows. Which would you choose? Yeah, me too. I would choose the one where I only pay one fee for all the shows and movies on the app ad free. Which app might that be? Netflix.</p>
<p>Although Hulu is the better choice for streaming TV networks you must pay individually for each network you want monthly and the price can add up quick and just to top it off not all things are ad free but with Netflix you only pay one monthly fee to receive ad free movies and shows. All the shows the app could possibly have are already on there so there is no need to pay for any extra subscriptions. The price you pay in the end for Netflix is by far way cheaper than what someone would pay for Hulu to watch all the possible movies and shows on there. Imagine how frustrating it could be to open your Hulu and look up a movie that you heard is on there just to realize that in order to watch that movie you have been looking forward to seeing you have to pay an extra $15 dollars a month and you must watch ads. But with Netflix you hear about a movie that was just released on there and you can know that you will be able to watch it without paying any extra money and it will be ad free.</p>
<p>Another main reason that Netflix is better than Hulu is because unlike Hulu Netflix will come out with a whole season at once instead of releasing one episode per week like Hulu does. Although Netflix will release a shows seasons later than Hulu you can binge watch them all at once instead of only getting to watch one per week. &nbsp;Just to top it off Netflix has a lot more original movies with up-and-coming actors, so you get to support those who are just now starting their dream career in acting instead of supporting the actors that are already receiving millions and millions of dollars and already have a huge fan base.</p>
<p>Netflix is the best option overall especially if you are on a budget. They don’t always have every movie that you would like to watch or every tv show but at least you are guaranteed an ad free movie/ tv show and you know that you won’t have to pay for an extra subscription just to watch a movie you heard was on there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The board of education had a meeting to come out with new ideas for future plans with school and sports. Some important decisions were made. Here are some of the main statements/ decisions made that will effect high schools and high school students.</p>
<ul>
<li>High School student athletes, including band, cheerleaders, and dance members will now each receive 4 tickets to give to their fans for games allowing family and friends to watch their student.</li>
<li>A decision as to if we will go back to in person learning or not will be made on October 26th. (remote learning will still be allowed if we do go back)</li>
<li>The end of the first 9 weeks will be on November 9th. This date will also be a “pivot point”. This means that if in person school is allowed then this will be a time where students will be allowed to transition back to in person school if they so desire.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> 	The BOE members of Wichita public schools made a heartbreaking announcement to cancel all fall sports activities in August. This decision came with great sadness and anger for many student athletes as well as parents from schools all over Wichita including usd 259 surrounding schools such as Maize, Andover ,Maize South etc. Only a few days later many people were forming plans to protest the decision to get their sports back that they had been working for all summer long and days after the BOE reversed their decision and brought fall sports back, here’s what motivated them to change their minds.</p>
<p> 	Some students were feeling more confused and angered than others about the decision cancelling fall sports. Many felt the decision was unfair and did not make sense because every other district in Kansas was following through with fall sports to give their student athletes a chance. Kylee Robertson, a Junior on the varsity cheerleading team felt very bothered by the original decision made.  </p>
<p>  “What bothered me the most about this decision was that every school district around Wichita public schools was going through with fall sports and we were one of the few that got it taken away without even being given a chance to prove that we will follow all safety precautions which we had been doing all summer during conditioning,” said Robertson. </p>
<p> 	When the BOE made this decision they had no idea what was about to happen. They received backlash from all social media platforms including, coaches, parents, students from Wichita public schools and schools from all over and many more people who just wanted the student athletes to be given a chance at a season. Less than a week after their decision, students in sports and band and students who just wanted to see their friends have the season they worked for, were getting together to form protests. There were protests held at Northwest and at North in hopes of changing the BOE members. </p>
<p>Camden Aldrich, a senior football player attended the protests after mourning the fact that he may no longer be having a senior football season. </p>
<p>“I don’t think that the BOE took into consideration what this decision did to the seniors. It took away scholarship opportunities and it took away some people&#8217;s last time to ever be on the field. Many of the people out there have been playing [football] since they were younger and this was their last year and they just took it away from them without giving them a chance,” said Aldrich before hearing that sports were back.	</p>
<p>Days after the decision that ended fall sports the BOE held a meeting that reversed their decision. The BOE made the choice to allow fall sports with precautions. These precautions consisted of no visitors being allowed to attend games, all students participating in high risk sports must attend school through my school remote, players must wear their masks on the sidelines and this decision included a few more smaller precautions. </p>
<p>	“This decision made us all feel accomplished and it made us feel like our voices were finally heard by the BOE members and they for once took our opinions into consideration,” Aldrich said after hearing the decision that sports were back on.</p>
<p>	After hard work forming protests and emailing board members, student athletes and their fans felt like their hard work had paid off. Many felt accomplished and felt that their voices were heard for once. What could potentially happen in the future with sports and COVID may be undetermined but these students will play their sports and cheer on their fellow student athlete friends until a potential change in the future. </p>
