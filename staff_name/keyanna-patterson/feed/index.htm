										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff and students completed the first tornado drill, using the two new tornado shelters on March 9.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our total time to get into the tornado shelters was right around nine minutes flat,” assistant principal Jacob Henning said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district hopes for the entire school to be in the two separate shelters in under five minutes. With 1,410 students participating in the drill this was a daunting task. Still, the school only fell a few minutes short of the goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The district would like us to be within five minutes, but they understand that with a school this size that is probably not a reality,” Henning said. “We had district personnel that were viewing and they were very impressed with how well we did,. They were very impressed with our time, especially for being our first drill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two new shelters are found around the new gym area, and in the new orchestra room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These areas can withstand an F5 tornado,” Henning said. “These two locations are probably some of the safest places in Wichita. They are very secure and safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the drill went smoothly, new routes to improve how fast we can get the entire school safe will always be under debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henning says that if everyone stayed to the correct side when traveling in G Hall the drill could run smoother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the first fire drill was timed, the entire school used G Hall to travel to the shelters. In the future the back hall will be opened and could also be used to take students and staff to the shelters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We tried to put barriers in to separate people, but we had some crossover which caused a backup in areas,” Henning said. “Right now we have no other way of getting to our two shelters, but in the future the back hall that leads to the new gym will be open so we can probably have a couple hallways go back through that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more practice and future drills, the time has room for improvement. The school was made safer by having two new shelters routes to get each person safely to said areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall we were all very pleased with the students,” Henning said. “They cooperated and we tried to make it as quick as possible. I’m thankful for all the teachers and the staff for their cooperation and still we want to get better, quicker and more organized.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">October 13, 2009: the day my life would be forever changed. Like any other day I went to school, but on this day I walked with pep in my step. At 4:10 I would sprint to my dad’s car and urge him to drive as fast as possible to Wesley Hospital, because my baby sister had been born earlier that morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had never been in an elevator that took as long as the one reaching her floor. I made sure to wash my hands super well, because I could not have my new best friend get sick. But you bet I was so happy holding my new sister. From that moment I decided that she was going grow up to be just like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well&#8230;she did, as she grew older she started to look like me, then talk like me, and even began to act like me. I felt as if a was given a half sized clone. Now she is six, and never would I have thought that over the years she would teach me more than I could ever teach her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love every moment, from the constant giggles, to driving her from school while she sings as loud as possible. One of my favorite things is when she reads to me and says, “Keyanna, I bet you didn’t know I could read this whole story in 47 seconds!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never did I expect the day she was born to change my life the way it has, but I am forever grateful for the impact that my mini-me has left on me by simply being herself.</span></p>
