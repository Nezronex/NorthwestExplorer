										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you never watched any anime but want to know where to start? Well I have compiled a list of 10 animes in no particular order that I think beginners should start off their anime journey with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attack On Titan</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: Action, dark fantasy, post-apocalyptic&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Ongoing&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Watch: Netflix and Hulu (I&#8217;ve watched almost all of these animes with a really good ad free anime website called 4anime.to but don’t let the government know that-)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: This is a legendary anime. It has gorgeous art and animation, you get connected with characters straight away and the plot is captivating. Definitely a recommendation for someone wanting a good series to get sucked into.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Hero Academia</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adventure, fantasy, superhero</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Ongoing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to watch: Hulu and Amazon Prime</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: Chances are that you’ve heard of this anime even without watching it. This anime has gotten so famous that it’s known worldwide and has millions of dedicated fans. And it has such a big following for a reason. The storytelling is beautiful, again, gorgeous art and animation, and the show is packed full of charming characters. In fact, my favorite anime character of all time comes from this very show. An all around astounding show.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haikyuu!!</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: Comedy, coming-of-age, Sports (volleyball)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Ongoing (only anime)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Watch: Hulu and Netflix</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: Much like My Hero Academia, this show also has a loyal audience. While these loveable and charming characters play volleyball, they learn the importance of teamwork, friendship, and determination. Definitely a recommendation if you’re wanting a really well made sports anime or just want to chill.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death Note</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: Mystery, psychological thriller</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Finished</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Watch: Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: I’d say that this is what a lot of people start off with. It is extremely well known in the anime community and gained a very large fandom. It’s pretty iconic, in my opinion. Definitely a must-watch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter x Hunter</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: Adventure and fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Ongoing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to watch: Netflix and Hulu</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: The plot is well paced and engaging with tons of charming characters to meet along the way. Definitely a recommendation if you’re looking for a longer anime to watch.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Promised Neverland</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: Thriller and dark fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Finished</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Watch: Netflix and Hulu</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: Immediately sucks you in by episode one. You’ll always be on the edge of your seat to find out what happens next.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banana Fish</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: Action, crime thriller</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Finished</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Watch: Amazon Prime</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: Absolutely amazing storytelling and characters you can’t help but love. WARNING: Do not watch this anime if you don’t want to be crying for days.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Silent Voice</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: Drama and romance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Finished</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Watch: Netflix and Amazon Prime</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: This is the first movie on this list, but it absolutely deserves to be here, With beautiful and smooth animation, gorgeous sound track and extremely well voice-acted characters, they all get put together to make a story that will pull on anyone’s heartstrings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri!!! On Ice</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: Sports (figure skating)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Ongoing (there’s a movie coming out soon!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Watch: Crunchyroll</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: I sometimes wish I could go back to when I had never watched this series before so I could experience it all over again. The way these two men express their love for each other when they&#8217;re out on the ice is more beautiful than what I can say in words. Just please go watch it, you won&#8217;t regret it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demon Slayer</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genre: Adventure fiction, dark fantasy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Status: Ongoing (there’s a movie coming out for this as well!!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to Watch: Hulu</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning: This is another one of those animes that has you hooked by episode one and makes just wanna keep watch. And in my opinion, this has one of the most beautiful art styles in all of anime. 20 out of 10, it’s fantastic.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Christmas less than a month away, people of all ages are starting up their annual Christmas traditions. Whether it’s with family, friends or significant others, seemingly everyone has some sort of holiday tradition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Hofhine spends her time bonding with her siblings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every Christmas Eve, me and my little siblings build a tent out of blankets and sheets and whatever we can find,” Hofhine said. “We put lights up around it in the living room and we all sleep in the tent.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to hanging out with siblings, Ameara Clark gets to visit another relative.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I go to my aunt’s house on Christmas Eve every year,” Clark said. “She’ll make a big dinner (I get a WHOLE pan of green bean casserole for myself) and we&#8217;ll trade white elephant gifts and eat cake balls.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesley Buser also has exciting traditions involving food.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In normal years, my grandma holds a gingerbread house decorating party with homemade houses, cookies, sandwiches, soups, and then holiday ice cream,” Buser said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America isn’t the only one with Christmas traditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">British kids are well acquainted with Father Christmas, Santa Claus or Saint Nick, but they can consider themselves lucky they don&#8217;t live in Austria, where a ghoulish creature called &#8216;Krampus&#8217;, the evil accomplice of St Nicholas, is said to wander the streets in search of badly-behaved children. During the month of December you can expect to see terrifying masked figures out and about scaring kids and adults alike with ghastly pranks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unusual tradition comes from Iceland, where a giant cat is said to roam the snowy countryside at Christmas time. Traditionally farmers would use the Yule Cat as an incentive for their workers &#8211; those who worked hard would receive a new set of clothes, but those who didn&#8217;t would be devoured by the gigantic cat-like beast.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this year, most cannot celebrate Christmas like they’re used to, because of Covid.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how the Coronavirus has impacted Chesley Buser’s Christmas traditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So my grandpa&#8217;s birthday is Christmas Eve and we normally have a bunch of parties to celebrate him and of course Christmas,&#8221; Buser said &#8220;We have a bunch of my family come down but this year it will just be my immediate family of me, my sister, mom, dad, mama, and papa. It will definitely be smaller but I hope that by next year things will be better,&#8221; Buser said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many students stuck inside thanks to Covid-19 have become tired of the daily routine.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing the same things day after day have sent some students into an endless cycle of boredom. But some of those students have found a way to break that cycle of boredom. While many students have chosen shows, sports or art to stifle their boredom, others have chosen video games. A big chunk of those students are choosing to play a game called Among Us.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us is a fast paced, multiplayer game with cartoony, short, spacesuit wearing participants which take place in various spaceship settings. Each game can consist of up to 10&nbsp; players.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of the players are crewmates, whose main goal is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do their assigned tasks that are set in various places within each map. But, up to three players can Imposters. Imposters can kill other players and also go into vents, which lead them into other rooms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a Crewmate or another Imposter finds a dead body, they can report it. All of the living players can then discuss who is the Imposter via a chat box. They can either come to a decision to vote someone out, or they can skip the vote if they don’t have a lot of information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point of the game is different for Crewmates and Imposters. The Crewmates need to find out who the Imposter(s) are, and vote them out before all of the crewmates get killed. An Imposter’s goal is to sabotage tasks and kill all of the Crewmates without getting caught.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being the Imposter requires you to be a good liar. You need to be prepared with an alibi for where you were, and if need be, to come up with a reason to blame someone else.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raena Ford very much enjoys this aspect of the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like the murder mystery part of it because you really don’t know who did it unless you were right there infront of them,. ” Ford said. “It’s really testing your ability to lie and defend.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While others might enjoy the game for strategic reasons, Renee Amaya appreciates playing the game for a different reason.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I enjoy the feeling of belonging and community. everyone&#8217;s in the game together trying to win whether you&#8217;re the impostor or crewmates,” Amaya said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some students like it for the strategic aspect and others like it for the community aspect, Lexi Stone enjoys it as a leisure opportunity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like it’s something you can do in your down time.” Stone said. “We’ve played them at football games just with band kids to ensure that we’re all playing at the same time, so I love how we have those options.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Among Us was officially released in June of 2018,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the game really blew up in early 2020 as an effect of quarantine. The game got picked up by millions of players worldwide, even some of the most popular YouTubers and streamers. People like Pewdiepie, Jacksepticeye, Corpse Husband, Mr Beast, and many others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game even got popular enough to have hundreds of people going as an Among Us character for Halloween. That caused many stores in various states to sell out of novelty spacesuits and space helmets, not to mention paint, dye, and fake knives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us has clearly brought a lot of people together, considering this quote from Amaya. “Among us is the perfect game to escape from the reality of our current world issues right now.”&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With quarantine keeping students all holed up inside their houses,&nbsp; students and teachers have had to come up with some creative ways to keep in contact, especially with school and after school clubs. But Covid-19 has not stopped the debate team from progressing and moving forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, the debate club chooses a topic to learn about and discuss in debates. This year, the topic is criminal justice. The students then prepare evidence and pair up with another student to face off with another student pair in front of at least one adult judge. But now, instead of doing the debates in-person, the debates take place within organized and structured Zoom meetings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong group of debaters has made overcoming this challenge easier according to the debate coach.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have an incredible group this year,” said debate teacher, Peter Crevoiserat, who is better known as Mr. Crevo. “I have more students in debate this year than any of my previous years, which is exciting, and I hope that trend continues. (&#8230;) If more people stick with debate, the sky&#8217;s the limit.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophomore Makayla Coy says debating this year is challenging, but still rewarding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A typical debate meeting now is kind of crazy from what it used to be,” Coy said.” “This was me and my partner’s first year, so we’ve gotten a grip on things. It’s been hard, but if you put your mind to it then it’s okay. (&#8230;) Other than that debate is great and I’m glad I joined it.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team has gone to three tournaments thus far, placing 3rd in two tournaments overall. The current top pair, consisting of Rylee Lopez and Josee Hoshaw, have placed in every tournament. Taking 2nd place at the Ad Astra tournament, 5th place at Wichita East, and 3rd place at Salina South. The pair consisting of Tristan Rice and Jack Rue took 4th place in Salina South.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Crevo stated that this has been a great season so far for the debate team, he just needs more participants. If you have any questions for Mr. Crevo or would like to join the debate team, please contact him via his email: pcrevoiserat@usd259.net</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first 2020 presidential campaign kicked off with a fiery debate this past Tuesday between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. With both candidates giving two minute answers to questions about Covid-19, police brutality and mass incarceration, it gave voters a lot to consider.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with multiple positive comments about health care and controlling the Coronavirus, came a lot of controversy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Biden calling Trump “un-presidential” and a “clown”, and Trump firing back with “I’ve done more in 47 months than you have in 47 years” and arguing with the moderator, it was a wild ride from start to finish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some students think that the debate showed that Trump was not presidential material.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump’s not really a politician,” Lenna Roberts stated. “We basically elected a businessman to be our president.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While another student said she felt like Trump was not forthcoming with his answers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raena Ford said, “He’s a question dodger. He always changes the subject.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This over two hour long debate was monitored by journalist and news anchor Chris Wallace. He was asked about his opinion on the debate and he was not pleased.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never dreamt that it would go off the tracks the way that it did,” Wallace said.</span></p>
