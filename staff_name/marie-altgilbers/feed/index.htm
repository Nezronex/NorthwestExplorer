										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">For those of you who haven’t had his class, this hatred may not be so well-known to you. For those of you who do know of this hatred, you might not have heard where it all started.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When he was about 17, math teacher Roger Powell was almost the victim of a homicide. The would-be murderer?</p>
<p dir="ltr">An ostrich.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was a dramatic day in my life,” Powell said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Powell was feeding ostriches when one decided it didn’t appreciate his presence in their pen. It attacked him, but barely missed injuring him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“After that, I just began a hatred for them, and I also figured out how dumb they are, which also made me hate them further,” Powell said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He often tells stories that demonstrate the stupidity of ostriches.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Job chapter 39 explains how dumb ostriches are,” Powell said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Powell’s hatred doesn’t seem to be abating anytime soon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think eventually I will get over my hatred of ostriches, but right now the scarring effects of that day run deep.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
