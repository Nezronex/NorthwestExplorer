										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a new year of school starts, new rules are often introduced. This year the student population has seen a huge shift in rules with two sticking out the most. Firstly ID’s are mandatory, and secondly all use of cell phones during class has been prohibited. Leading to a general level of turbulence in the classroom with students and teachers often butting heads over the new policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with this several students believe that the new restrictions on phones can negatively impact their education, as Channing Aiken a senior puts it, “Simply teachers used cell phones for educational uses, whether it be for games like Kahoot, or things like if a website is blocked.” This creates an interesting point that phones do have a level of educational use, one that can’t easily be replaced by the heavily restricted laptops that students receive at the beginning of the year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even some students can admit how distracting they can be and how bad it can throw off their work. As Johnny Huynh a junior puts it, “I think I used my cell phone in like all my classes… I couldn’t get any work done.” This shows that at least even a few students can recognize the harmful potential cell phones can have on education.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the new students, many of whom weren’t able to use cell phones previously in middle school, many of them aren’t super passionate. Casey Helms a freshmen states, “I was kinda excited to have phones, but at the end of the day it isn’t a big deal.” Overall this best represents how students have varying thoughts on the new rule, and the change it will have on the classroom environment both positive and negative.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y.E, Youth Entrepreneurs, is a class Northwest offers to Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors. The class teaches students the basics of starting and running a business, this includes the learning of COGS, revenue streams, business plans, etc. There are currently two classes of Y.E at Northwest, one ran by Chris Lambert and the other ran by Gavin Darr. The class to say the least requires a lot of effort for the students, so last year after everything was said and done both teachers pooled together and formed a game to reward students for all of their hard work. They decided that a kickball match would be held between the two classes in order to give them a fun way to wind down. However this would have the unintentional effect of creating a sort of joking rivalry between Darr and Lambert after Darr’s team won the first year of kickball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year Lambert was determined to win and so when the game commenced he hyped up his class. Running them through rules, and just ensuring that&nbsp; above all else they were having fun. Since Lambert had lost the previous year, his team was up to kick first. They got off to a phenomenal start as the first kicker slammed the ball across the field. Allowing for the first kicker to make it straight to second base.&nbsp; The game continued with a back and forth pattern, one team would score 2 or 3 points the other team would score 1-2.&nbsp; By the middle of the match Darr&#8217;s team was 2 point behind Lambert&#8217;s, and the pressure was kept up. The next kicker, and first of his inning, Johnny Huynh hit a straight shot right through the defenses of Darr’s team. Allowing Lambert&#8217;s team to get a free home-run, driving the score up by one more. Momentum from there continued and it seemed like the match had been settled.&nbsp; In the end Lambert held their lead and won the 2nd Annual Y.E Kickball game with a final score of 9-7. Although Darr’s team lost, both teams enjoyed themselves with lots of laugh and overall positive energy in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d say overall it was pretty fun and very engaging, it was a good way to end off the year,” said Sam Hohman student Lambert&#8217;s class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">A pungent smell invades the nostrils of Abby Fickle as she frantically grabs the keepsakes from her car. A sense of urgency seems to drown out the chaos, she grabs the last of her things that she can get at this moment and takes off. Away from her precious car as it is engulfed in flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">Abby Fickle, a junior at Northwest who loved her car, a Volkswagen Beetle nicknamed Spike, an astronomical amount. For Abby and her friend Tianna Piña it was a fairly normal lunch at the start of a new year. They had just gotten into Abby’s car and had attempted to turn on the air conditioning. It turned on but both of them noticed a sliver of smoke emerging from the controls. At this point in time they still drove it around this is where the first signs of trouble started appearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The smell started becoming something very very strong to the point where you could feel it inside your stomach and made you grossed out,” Tianna Piña, (11), said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">After a while things started picking up, according to Tianna and Abby. The smoke grew darker black and increased in quantity. The stench carried by it became even more gut-wrenching at this point in time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“The black smoke kind of reminded me of a house fire, but luckily we were just in a car, so we could get out safely,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the black smoke started sweeping through her car, Fickle drove back to school grounds. Thinking quickly, Fickle drove her car into the parking lot away from other vehicles, calling her dad for advice and help. They opened up the hood and in the process discovered the fire on the side of her car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“He told us to disconnect the cable from the battery just in case that would help, and as I rounded the corner of the car we saw the fire fuming,” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">As the fire raged on, the windows were the first to break due to the intense heat. After that,&nbsp; Fickle and Piña were escorted away from the vehicle and into the nurse’s office. There the realization of what had truly happened hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“What was going through my mind was&nbsp; something that was new to me, and I don’t know why I reacted this way, but I started laughing,” Piña said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">While Piña felt hysteria, Fickle understandably felt pure sadness not only that, but also she had endured a borderline traumatic experience. At the nurse’s office both were found to be healthy, despite all circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“I kept getting reminded by dad whenever I was sad about it, that if I had done anything different we both could have died, or something worse could have happened” Fickle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">The car itself was totaled, a large portion of it completely destroyed by flames. Fickle only had liability insurance though, leaving her without a vehicle at this moment, but Fickle does have plans to bring back some life back into an old mustang her sister owned.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;">“It’s weird, a change, but we worked on it all day and now I drive that,” Fickle said. </span></p>
