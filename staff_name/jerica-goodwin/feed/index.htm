										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It usually ends with a neighborhood full of people caressing candles in their hands, tears running down cheeks, dozens and dozens of flowers everywhere and a portrait of the deceased. The school usually has a ceremony of some sort where students gather and pray. The story makes the news, trends on Twitter and becomes the latest controversy on Facebook. Suddenly, everyone in the United States becomes familiar with the name and story. Everyone is heartbroken. Students from the high school are interviewed and they all say things about ‘how she was so pretty’ or ‘he was the nicest guy ever’ or ‘so many of us were your friends, and we all loved you so much.’ But if that was really the case, then why did this person feel the need to end their life? Why did this person commit suicide because she/he was being bullied at school? Why does everyone all of sudden like this person, when they are dead? Where were we when this person actually needed us, and probably begged for us to be there for them? Why did this person feel so alone and like everyone hated them if ‘so many of us were your friends, and we all loved you so much’?<br />
Teen suicide has sadly become so popular and common that it’s not unusual to hear of a story about another teen who decided to hang themselves, or overdose on pills or put a bullet right through their skull. In fact, suicide is so common today that it is ranked the third leading cause of death among the ages of 15-24, and is the fourth leading cause of death among 10-14 year olds (teensuicidestatistics.com.) To give you even more chills, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, it is reported that the suicide rate among the ages 15-24 has increased 6 percent and ages 10-14 the rate has increased 100 percent.<br />
Let’s go back to this cliche statement ‘so many of us were your friends, we all loved you so much.’ Why didn’t any of you stand up for this teenager that was clearly being bullied? If so many of you cared and loved this human being then why did none of you try to help? Teensuicide.us claims that each person who ends up committing suicide has actually attempted suicide 25 times. 25 times. How did all of this go unseen? All of the warning signs just didn’t exist? No. They existed, but you ignored them. You didn’t think it was that serious. You didn’t want to look like a ‘loser’ talking to the person who got bullied every day at school. But now that the person is dead, you care.<br />
The Amanda Todd story is a perfect example. On September 7, a 15 year old girl from Vancouver, Canada uploaded a video to YouTube. The video was in black and white with her face out of the frame, she held oversized note cards to the camera that contained writing on them, thoroughly explaining what she had been through. After watching the video you learn about her story. She ends the video with a card that says ‘I have nobody, I need someone.’ On October 10, just a little over a month after posting this video she was dead.<br />
Now her name is trending on Twitter. There are Facebook statuses about her. People are making tweets, saying how much they will miss her, and how much they cared and loved her. She begged for someone to be there for her, and nobody came to her side. She sat alone at lunch. And this video floated around YouTube for 33 days, and she still felt alone. She still killed herself after pleading for a friend.<br />
It happens in almost every suicidal teen case. The teenager gets popular after they die. The whole student body is suddenly their best friend. Now everyone wants to be there for him/her. Everyone wants to bring him/her back. It. Is. Too. Late. We start caring once the person is dead. We want to reach out to the person once he/she is dead. We have to actually care when the person has a beating heart. Usually all it takes is one person to prevent the lonely and depressed teen from killing themselves.<br />
The number of suicidal deaths is almost as high as homicide and HIV/AIDS deaths combined (web4health.info.) 19.3% of high school students have seriously considered killing themselves, and 14.5% of high schoolers have actually attempted suicide according to teensuicidestatistics.com. These percentages are simply too high, especially among our age group. Our life hasn’t even begun in high school. We have so much to live for, so much more to experience and enjoy. We have to start taking things more seriously. We never know when a person from our English class is planning on going home and ending everything.<br />
We can’t wait until it’s too late, and then start caring. Once they’re dead, unfortunately there’s no bringing them back. Care when there’s a chance of prevention. We shouldn’t be used to hearing stories about how teens were pushed to the edge and they committed suicide. We need to make this less common.<br />
Instead of making tweets with the hashtag ‘RIPAMANDA’ we should’ve been hashtagging “AmandaImHereForYou’ the day that video leaked to YouTube, then maybe it wouldn’t have been too late. Instead of holding candles and roses in remembrance of someone we should watch them blow out birthday candles and celebrate a new year with them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They got spirit, yes they do! They got spirit, how ‘bout you? If you’ve ever wanted to be one of those girls who wear the blue and gold pleated skirts, huge bows in their hair, and perform at every pep assembly, you’re in luck because tryouts are just around the corner.</p>
<p>“Before tryouts there are three informational meetings, and you have to attend at least one of those meetings to make the team,” cheerleading coach Tiffany Houle said.</p>
<p>In order to make the team, there are a couple of school related requirements. First, you have to have a 2.5 GPA and you can’t have an F in any core classes. Other requirements are you must be able to accomplish a toe-touch and one other jump of your choice. The last thing that is misunderstood according to Houle is that cheerleading is a year-round commitment.</p>
<p>The pricing for a first time cheerleader is 750 dollars however, if you are a returning cheerleader the pricing is 520 dollars. The cheerleaders do many fundraisers, and the profits made by the fundraisers take out what is owed from the 750/520 dollars.</p>
<p>“[The cost] is a little bit expensive, personally it’s not expensive for my family but for others it is,” freshman Breanne Hardiman said.</p>
<p>The cost of cheerleading wouldn’t be so high if the school would actually fund the sport.</p>
<p>“I think we should get more funding from the school     because we are at every game, no matter how the weather is, so we deserve it,” sophomore Karlee Cooper said.</p>
<p>Since cheerleading is a year round commitment, including practicing in the summer, the cheerleaders get to know each other extremely well.</p>
<p>“We spend so much time practicing together, and cheering at games we become a family. We all become close and before the year is over we are inseparable,” sophomore Taryn Niedens said.</p>
<p>Therefore the cheerleaders are more than just the people trying to pump the basketball and football teams up at games, they are a ‘family.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He’s a new face here at Northwest. He’s here all day everyday. His job is to keep everyone safe, and with ten years experience he successfully does that. It’s security guard Brian Martin, some of you may know him by his nickname, Boe. Martin isn’t your typical intimidating security guard, walking in the halls you can see he has a big fan base, and just likes to have fun while working.</p>
<p>“I like how I can joke around, everything doesn’t have to be tense all the time. I don’t want kids to look at me and think ‘oh he’s a security guard we better stay away from him’ because I like to have fun, Martin said. Kids can come up to me and we can joke around from time to time.”</p>
<p>When Martin isn’t giving new drivers parking decals, checking who’s in Cave, filling out reports on lost items, or supporting Market Day by eating three bowls of ice cream drinking two cherry limeades and tasting some tacos. Martin is where we see him the most, walking around the commons and hallways making sure every student is getting to class.</p>
<p>“Some days are boring, you’re just wondering ‘am I gonna’ get a call’? “But then that’s like saying we want something bad to happen, and we don’t. Sometimes the job just gets boring if there’s nothing going on. But we also have our busy days too.”</p>
<p>Watching Martin during passing period and at lunch, we can all see that a majority of us are stopping just to conversate with him, and get a few laughs in before we leave to our next class.</p>
<p>“I hope they (students) think I’m a good person. I’m easy to get along with. I hope they see that they can come and talk to me about their problems and we can get the problem solved. Most of them know they can talk to me,” Martin said. “But I hope they see me as a good guy.”</p>
<p>Other than having to carry around all his equipment, which includes his badge, handcuffs, maze, walkie-talkie, and gloves, Martin doesn’t dislike anything about his job. In fact he feels right at home here.</p>
<p>“The administration is pretty cool, and the students are cool too. So it’s good here.”</p>
<p>And although retirement is further down the road for this beloved security guard, he knows exactly what he miss will most.</p>
<p>“I’ll just miss the kids. I’ll miss helping them,” Martin said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High school. When some people hear that word they think of it as the best time of their lives, while others think of it as their worst. Only being a sophomore, I can’t really say for sure which way I’ll think of high school after I graduate, but here’s what I think so far.</p>
<p>Sports. Homecomings. Pep rallies. Freedom. Those are only a few things that make high school worthwhile. There are sports to play and events to watch. Homecomings to dance with your crush. Pep rallies to show school spirit. And freedom to finally drive and leave for lunch.</p>
<p>Credits. Colleges. And cliques. Now these are a few things that make some of us dread high school. You can’t slack off in any classes, there’s credits that must be earned in order to graduate. Colleges and scholarships put pressure on us to know what we want to pursue in life. And cliques sometimes makes us lose our closest friends.</p>
<p>No matter which side you’re on when it comes to the word, meaning, and realization of high school, you will always remember the experience. Whether the memories made throughout the four years are some we wish we could re-live. Like having a crown placed on your head for winning homecoming. Scoring the winning point in a game. Or rekindling a flame you shared with your crush, the memories will follow you for a lifetime. On the other hand you might have memories you wish could fade away. Like that one time you lost your best friend. Or when you when you had to retake a class because you failed, and you needed that one credit. Good or bad. Enjoyable or brutal. The four years spent in high school are never forgotten.</p>
<p>For example, chemistry teacher Carl Hinote’s high school experience was the best years of his life, while language arts teacher, Katie Adams’ not so much. Adams remembers her high school years as nerdy. Adams focused on school a lot; she always wanted to maintain her 4.0 GPA.</p>
<p>“The most memorable thing from my high school years was a math grade. I was never great at math, I was always awful. I remember I use to write out paragraphs next to my answers to explain how I got them. And my math teacher gave me my first D, he said he didn’t accept essays. It almost messed up my 4.0, luckily I got my grade my up with extra credit.”</p>
<p>Although she had the grades she wanted throughout high school, which was a plus, the negative things she dealt with and had been through during high school, she wouldn’t ever want to re-live.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have the best high school experience, so to that essence yes [I would re-do high school]. But there’s no way you could pay me to go back through what I went through again. So overall, no.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Hinote had some of the best years ever in high school. He thought of high school has a ‘social time’. In fact, his high school experience was so great, he had a hard time deciding what was the best memory he had, but when it came to the worst memory the answer was ‘mandatory finals’.</p>
<p>“The best memory was prom. Senior prom. Our theme was named after a movie, ‘Sea of Love’, so there was like 100 of us that went to see the movie before prom, then we ate, and went to prom. So it was a really fun time.”</p>
<p>With a ton of good memories, Hinote does have one regret.</p>
<p>“If I could re-do high school I would. I would get more involved. Like with drama, and sports. I wasn’t ever involved until my senior year. ”</p>
<p>In conclusion, Hinote had the best time in high school, while Adams’ had one of the worst times. Hinote has memories he can still think about and smile, Adams’ has memories she has to force herself to think about when getting interviewed, and every question was answered with a frown. Hinote’s experience was good and enjoyable. Adams’ was bad, and maybe even brutal. Although these two teachers have different perspectives on high school, each teacher remembers the experience. Why? Because the four years spent in high school are never forgotten.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senior Sara Schoenberger had been a fan of the MTV reality TV shows “16 and Pregnant” and “Teen Mom.” Watching the shows every time a new episode aired, Schoenberger never thought she would become one of those girls. However, Schoenberger had suspicions of being pregnant her junior year. After being continuously asked to take a test by the baby’s father, Schoenberger finally did. Seeing the pink plus sign, Schoenberger wasn’t too shocked; she already figured she was, the only thing she was worried about was telling her parents.</p>
<p>“I never told my parents; they asked me if I was [pregnant] because I was getting sick a lot,” Schoenberger said.</p>
<p>Her parents reacted better than she thought. Although her mom was “rude” about the situation, both parents were there for their 17-year-old daughter. Schoenberger’s parents pushed her to keep her options open. Her mother really wanted Schoenberger to consider adoption, but her mind was already made up.</p>
<p>“I knew I was going to keep her. I just couldn’t give up something that was inside of me.”</p>
<p>Schoenberger’s junior year was changing drastically. Not only was Schoenberger pregnant, but she was also the new girl at Northwest, having transferred from Bishop Carroll. Schoenberger felt like all eyes were on her every single day.</p>
<p>“It showed me who my real friends were. Some people became more distant.”</p>
<p>At times Schoenberger felt alone. Her relationship with her parents had somewhat changed, some of her friends acted like they never knew her, and she felt the baby’s father wasn’t even there for her in the beginning.</p>
<p>“He was selfish about the situation. He only thought about him and his future,” She said.</p>
<p>February 22 was when Schoenberger’s life changed forever. After having cramps the night before, she went to her scheduled doctor’s appointment. An hour later <em>it was time</em>. Schoenberger’s mother and two close friends were with her at the hospital. Finally, at 11:53 p.m. Schoenberger was holding her baby daughter, Melia.</p>
<p>“My first impression was ‘wow, this is crazy. My daughter is really pretty.”</p>
<p>For the next month, Schoenberger was out of school to take care of her newborn baby. The first night home from the hospital was hard to adapt to.</p>
<p>“She cried a lot, and she woke up so many times.”</p>
<p>The following weeks were filled with dirty diapers, baby vomit, bottles, and little sleep. Returning to school with a baby was something she never imagined herself doing. The first day of senior year for Schoenberger was Melia’s first day at the Northwest Child Development Center.</p>
<p>“I never took her to daycare my junior year. I didn’t want her to get sick by other babies. I was very careful and cautious when she was first born,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s been close to one year since Schoenberger’s belly grew and Melia was born. Now, Schoenberger’s relationship with her parents has improved, and Melia’s dad is in the picture. Schoenberger says school is still easy for her, and she has no problem juggling her job at Xenon’s and raising her daughter.</p>
<p>“Nights are easier now; she sleeps the whole night. But during the day Melia is more high maintenance since she’s moving now. When she’s sick or teething it’s really hard. She gets super cranky,” she said.</p>
<p>Going through and adapting to all the changes, one thing has managed to stay the same for Schoenberger.</p>
<p>“My goals haven’t changed. I want to go to college and make money,” Schoenberger said.</p>
