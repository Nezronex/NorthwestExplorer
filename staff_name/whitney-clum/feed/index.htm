										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were all there for what, in my mind, should be deemed, “The Twilight Mess of ‘08. People were being sent to the office for fights between Team Jacob and Team Edward. I couldn’t watch TV without seeing Kristen Stewarts bored face all over my screen. Even Wal-Mart betrayed me with calendars, CD’s, candy bars, and multiple editions of Twilight covers everywhere. </p>
<p>As much as I despise Twilight, I understand that there were several people who liked it. I didn&#8217;t blame companies for wanting to promote itself with what was turning into a multi-billion dollar franchise. I wasn’t mad at the author for creating something popular. </p>
<p>I was, however, frustrated with the over-saturation.<br />
This concept did not begin with Twilight. Twilight just happens to be something that caught everyone’s attention that I didn&#8217;t personally like. Every time something becomes popular, the market catches on to something, we see so much of it that we become sick of it. After Twilight came The Hunger Games, and suddenly the only books that were being published were ones centered about dystopian futures and tyrannical governments.  </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with going with what is popular and what works.  It’s called good business sense. However, every time a new trend catches on, and everyone refuses to produce anything except related products, we shut out original products and ideas. That is where the real problem lies. </p>
<p>“Original ideas” is not code for “pushing the envelope a far as it can go,” either. In fact, trying to offend as many sensibilities as possible is another trend over-saturating media right now. The best thing we can do is encourage what we like, but be willing to try something outside the norm that doesn’t rely on shocks to disguise itself as originality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The library is now offering a blind dating service. A blind date with a book, that is.</p>
<p>To try to encourage reading, certain books are now being concealed in Valentine’s day themed wrapping paper, waiting to be picked up. Students are then encouraged to pick up one of the “mystery” novels, take it to the checkout counter, then unwrap it to discover what book they are having a “blind date” with. </p>
<p>The rules are simple: read at least 30 pages. When you finish, come back and rate your book on a scale from “horrible” to “amazing.”  </p>
<p>“I really want to try it. It sounds really cool,” says freshman McKayla Siemiller. </p>
<p>The hope is that the draw of the unknown will tempt more kids to read.</p>
<p>“Books are important because they are real people’s stories, and you get to experience and understand another world, another person’s feelings and experiences. Reading makes us better people,” says Lizanne Minerva.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Superheroes are here to save television.</p>
<p>Well, to be precise, TV networks want superheroes, and their massive pre-existing fanbase  to bring them viewers (and therefore money).Several TV channels are planning to bring the stories of several comic book heroes and villains to life.</p>
<p>Fox is bringing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d1zpt6k5OI">GOTHAM</a> to the table, a show that picks up right after Bruce Wayne’s parents are murdered. It is being marketed as a giant origin story for both heroes and villains told from the POV of detective Jim Gordon. The only Batman villain not expected to make an appearance is Ra’s Al Ghul, the leader of the League of Assassins, the theory behind the absence of the villain is thought to be because he is expected to appear in the CW’s ARROW.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKE36sL6jKc">ARROW</a> is a popular television show based off of DC comics’ Green Arrow franchise and is currently hyping up excitement by releasing clips of major villain Ra’s Al Ghul, car chases, and appearances of Ray Palmer; the man who will later become The Atom.  It’s spin-off, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj0l7iGKh8g">THE FLASH</a>, features bumbling forensic scientist Barry Allen who finds himself struck by lighting and in a coma for nine months, only to wake up as the fastest man alive. After the pilot was screened at the San Diego Comic-Con, critics agreed that THE FLASH was not only the most promising of all of the new shows,but was also the most lighthearted, unlike it’s grittier “mother” show, or its competition,  NBC’s CONSTANTINE.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPE2oBnzROY">CONSTANTINE</a> is aiming to bring horror lovers to NBC with a TV series centered around the darker, scarier, side of comics. Think paranormal activity with a detective/vigilante as the lead character with DC characters such as Doctor Fate and Zatanna teased to join the show later.</p>
<p>On MARVEL side of the television spectrum, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tkfi6QtZQw">Agents of SHIELD</a> (whose ratings improved after Captain America: Winter soldier) is being renewed for a second season with the underlying uneasiness of “no-one-can-be-trusted” chatter surrounding the show following the revealing of major characters in the show being connected to HYDRA.  While Marvel seems to be dragging its feet with its other upcoming TV series, AGENT CARTER,  other properties are being put into the “in development” stage.</p>
<p>Whether you like superheroes or not, the sheer amount of DC/Marvel shows on television is important. First, it shows what people want to watch, which means TV channels will order similar shows, leading to realistic TV shows having a much harder job selling their pitch. Second, comics shows off America in a way nothing else can. Every culture has stories that change and reflect the views of that particular group as time goes on. The Greeks had their myths, the British have King Arthur, but comic books? Comic books really started turning into something popular in America during the Great Depression, and the stories have grown with America, featured American heroes (Captain America) and reflected American values and beliefs. In the end, aren’t most comic book heros supposed to represent truth, justice, and the American way?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">1.     <strong>Don&#8217;t even think about procrastinating.</strong> You may have been able to pull off three hundred point projects the night before in the past, but not now &#8212; not only do you not have recovery time if you flop, but with so many harder projects, you cannot afford to get bad grades on time-consuming but easy projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. <strong>Study.</strong> Find papers from the first quarter and conduct a short review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">3.     <strong>Prioritize.</strong> During the week before finals &#8212; the week where we are all reasonably sure that teachers are cackling in a room over the amount they assigned us, and it is not humanly possible to get everything done &#8212; deal with the classes you have the lowest grade in. Then deal with the big projects; you can probably do worksheets during class or during lunch, whereas big papers are difficult to work on in another class.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">4.     <strong>Take short breaks.</strong> In between two heavy subjects, read a chapter of a fluffy book that doesn’t have a plot that would weigh on your mind. Go on a run. Watch a 20-minute show on Netflix.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">5.     <strong>Don&#8217;t mess with your eating habits.</strong> You need to have constants, so if you are on a giant studying binge, don&#8217;t decide that breakfast is a good idea at four in the morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">6.     <strong>Caffeine.</strong> Although caffeine is not that great for you, and over time it actually lowers your energy levels, once in a while, it can work like a placebo. If you think you are getting an energy boost from that Sprite, you can fool yourself into thinking you are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">7.     <strong>Ask teachers for a look at what will be on the finals.</strong> That way you won&#8217;t waste time on stuff you don’t need to know.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">8.    This is probably the most useful tip: <strong>find people who have taken the course you are in.</strong> Ask them about what you can do &#8212; experience is the best teacher.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">God’s not Dead is the Christian small budget film that shot to #3 in the box office during it’s limited release opening weekend that features a college student named Josh Wheaton who refuses to write the words, “God is dead” on a slip of paper during his philosophy class, forcing him to stand up and make a series of speeches proving that God is alive if he wants to pass the class.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was so psyched for this movie, as in, buying the soundtrack and blabbing about it over every social media site I was on before seeing it on opening night. The movie features four storylines: the  first one features Josh vs the atheist professor Radisson, their back stories, and what happens in their personal lives outside the classroom showdowns.  The second storyline follows a highly liberal reporter who is dating a jerk of a businessman (this is one that got sad fast.)The third storyline featured a Christian girl living inside a traditional Muslim household, and the fourth was more or less the comic relief storyline, and it was about a pastor who wants to impact people like his best buddy who is a Nigerian missionary. Each subplot brushes against another one at some point in the movie, so even explaining one gives away a giant spoiler for another.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The movie  was EXCELLENT.  The movie was balanced with funny moments, sad moments, and moments that made the tension in the theatre so thick you could have cut it with a knife. Even characters you went in hating (i.e. Professor Radisson) you left having a lot of sympathy for, or at least relating to. There were moments where the entire theatre starting to murmurs and people around me were whispering around me; “shots fired.” During two points in the movie, people got up and started clapping.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most importantly, the movie didn’t pull any punches from either side during the debate in the classroom. The professor used arguments from Stephen Hawking, Charles Darwin, and other scientists that are cited often in anti-Christian arguments but the answers to the professor were well researched and were backed by a lot of science. While I won’t spoil the end of the debate for anyone, it was clear that the writers put a lot of thought into the arguments used  and the movie.</p>
<p>This movie wasn’t just a good movie, it was an important movie. The similar events like the ones portrayed in the movie happen all the time, and cases and descriptions about said cases were in the credits at the end. People gets in fist fights all the time in philosophy classes, and this movie, no matter what anyone thinks about it, brings up arguments people actually use, and the responses to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Since the majority of Northwest will be attempting to find some sort of enjoyment out of spring break, and since most of us have long forgotten what the meaning of the elusive word “fun” means, a guide on how to make your spring break fun must be made.</p>
<p dir="ltr">First off, Netflix. If you don&#8217;t have it, poo for you. If you do, don&#8217;t bother reading the rest of this, because Netflix will be your spring break.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Second, food. Apparently, humans need sustenance to survive. However, getting up from the couch, toilet, or bed (wherever you have decided to set up camp during the week) requires  a certain amount of energy. So using the last vestiges of energy on Friday that you get from the excitement over the prospect of a week spent doing about the same amount of work as Congress, buy a ton of food. Junk food. Shame on your cow if you decided to associate with that organic crap. Buy Twinkies. Purchase Gatorade. Order pizza and offer to pay extra if they deliver it to the couch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Third: Minimal human contact. This is your week; not anyone else’s! You do not HAVE to indulge anybody by talking to them. You can discourage people from disrupting your week of brain-paralysis by grunting ominously every time someone comes within ten feet of you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fourth: A few of you will actually attempt to DO something with your spring break, other than any of the things mentioned above. This includes getting outside, shopping for things you actually need, shopping for things you really don&#8217;t need, seeing a movie, or gasp working! In that case, enjoy. You won’t have a lot more time in the near future in which you won’t have a project or test hanging around, so take it while you can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The first amendment, one of the most important building blocks of the foundation of the United States. It sickens me that it always seems to be under attack.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As citizens, the First Amendment guarantees us the right of freedom of speech, press, religion, petition and assembly. We can print what we want to print, say what we want to say, worship who we feel we should, gather in groups and write angry letters to the government if we want to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I firmly agree with these rights, which is what makes me furious every time I see the first amendment being ignored, deliberately misinterpreted, and altogether broken on both the local and federal level. The freedom of speech seems to be one of the rights that are violated with frightening frequency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">French enlightenment writer Voltaire once said that, “I do not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” More and more, instead of defending our right to say what we want to, the government’s attitude has been more along the lines of, “Say what you want, but only if we agree with it.”  Courts and school boards have been ruling more and more in the favor of squelching anyone, everyone and anything that doesn’t support Obama’s administration and or a liberal agenda.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reporter’s houses have been raided and notes pertaining to articles that would not be favorable to the government were confisticated; Harvard ( a very liberal college) is putting out students who actually believe and have stated in their papers that that the first amendment should be repealed, “because free speech threatens liberalism.” In California, a student with pro-life posters was assaulted by a staff member after refusing to take down their posters and quoting the campus free-speech policy. The student then had their posters ripped up, shoved multiple times against a wall, and shoved out of an elevator.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The problem is, people don’t seem to know how to use the freedom of speech. Some people have the mistaken belief that free speech also gives you protection of your opinion. No. You have the right to say anything you want, but every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and putting your opinion out there makes you free game to be disagreed with. If are disagreed with, then discuss differences-something we should have a right to. The founding fathers gave us the right to discuss our differences freely, and unfortunately, we have thrown that right into the trash in favor of shutting people down.</p>
<p>Our principles as a nation have been under attack, and we need to stop ourselves from sliding into a nation that is a cruel mockery of what we are supposed to be. Go ahead and disagree with me, go ahead and tell me, you have the right to do so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">During our three days of snow, I decided to watch Netflix-lots of Netflix. After scrolling through my comfort shows, starting a new show sounded like a good idea since I had three days to binge and drool over said show if I liked it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the description, Chuck is a show about a guy named Chuck who is an underachiever who gets government secrets downloaded into his head and turns into a government asset. The description alone was what made me avoid it: it sounded dumb. So I went in thinking it would be something like the people who wrote a sitcom trying their hand at a grittier type of show.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I was wrong. Completely wrong.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chuck is a person who got kicked out of Stanford unfairly who has had all of his confidence crushed by working at a California version of Best Buy and is the head of the Nerd Herd, a group who goes out and fixes computers. His ex-best friend who turns out to be a rogue government agent sends him an email that uses embedded pictures to implant government secrets into his head-and then the only computer holding the secrets now in Chuck&#8217;s head is destroyed.  A CIA agent, Sarah Walker (the love interest) and NSA agent John Casey are sent to protect him-but they soon realize the only way to use the information for good is to take him on missions with them, forcing Chuck to balance his spy life and real life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The characters were great and likable.  Chuck is sweet and has a strong moral code, which conflicts often with the wants of the CIA, and makes for a likeable lead character. Sarah is an agent who uses her looks to go undercover, which distracts from the fact she is highly trained in martial artist with relationship issues.  John Casey is a tough, trigger-happy  NSA agent with a fearsome demeanor. Together, the three of them form a triad of awesome  to head up the “A” plot line. His sister, her fiance Devon (More commonly known as ‘Captain Awesome’, from the family of ‘Very Awesomes), his best friend Morgan and the Nerd Herd usually form the “B” plot, which is what is happening in Chuck’s real life and usually pretty goofy. Sometime in the episode, both storylines collide forcing Chuck to cover for himself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The show is smart, funny, and engaging. No character is useless and the show throws out plenty of jokes without sacrificing plot. By the end of the episode, you wonder how on earth they packed so much into one episode, and it is addictive. I burst out laughing several times, whether it was at Captain Awesome’s horrible lying skills (“I didn’t pick up my phone because I was decapitating a bear!) or Casey saying everything in the same grating voice.  (“Don’t puke on the C4”) No line is wasted and you end up falling in love with the characters, no matter how bad they screw up. And every character grows, so the show never gets stale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Verdict: I loved it. Normally crime shows bore me, but I was able to sit through episode after episode, which makes itself the first show that has not been sci-fi/fantasy to make me do that. This is such an underrated show that deserves to have a bigger fanbase than it does. It’s on Netflix, so I would recommend going home and watching it-if you think you can stop at one.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIqEWRt8sBo">How to be a deadly spy according to John Casey</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Quote from the show:</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t do that, because I have two protectors that will come running with guns blazing when they hear my girly scream”</p>
