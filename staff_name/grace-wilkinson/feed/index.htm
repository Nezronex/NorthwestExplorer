										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a disease throwback to the measles just this year, it seems more and more people are listening to celebrities for medical advice. It’s too easy to take status as authority in this day and age, and ignore the potential risks. </p>
<p>Students are required to get the necessary vaccinations to attend public school, but have the option to opt out for religious reasons. However, even the more conservative religions (i.e. amish) have been permitting, even encouraging vaccinations in the past decades.</p>
<p>The only real opposition comes from public figures like Gwyneth Paltrow, who believes her feelings can alter the molecular structure of water, obviously a very well-versed woman in the area of science. </p>
<p>Anti-vax parents blame vaccinations for many disabilities and ailments, despite experts refuting this time and time again, the most popular, and seemingly only, study supporting these claims has been admitted, by the scientist Mark Geier, to be false, as well as dismissed by The Institute of Medicine.</p>
<p>Many parents still are still wary of the unnatural ingredients in vaccines, such as preservatives, and the risk of deadly allergic reactions to the vaccines. However, the risk is less than a hundredth of a percent for a child to go into anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p>The preservative in vaccines, thimerosal, that was believed to cause autism has been subject to countless studies, and has overwhelmingly been proved a myth, and is no longer present in many new vaccinations.</p>
<p>This spread of false information is not only detrimental to the unvaccinated children, and all the people they put at risk, but to individuals with disabilities like autism as well. It makes it seems as if they have something wrong with them.</p>
<p>The only medical risk that would get it the way of vaccination is if a child were to have an autoimmune disorder and aren’t strong enough to receive the vaccinations. This disorder also makes them more susceptible to diseases, giving even more reason to get other children vaccinated.</p>
<p>It should be a public duty to vaccinate, as the benefits heavily outweigh the risks. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems when someone wants to be rude, they cite the first amendment, as if it gives them an excuse to stomp on any objections. Because it’s “just their opinion.”<br />
The amendment reads as such: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”</p>
<p>When broken down, there is nothing that says “harass people with whatever you want, without any repercussions.”</p>
<p>When the journalists at Charlie Hebdo were shot, thousands rallied behind this ‘satirical’ magazine, saying the attack was on free speech.<br />
When Michael Brown was shot, and when Treyvon Martin was shot, everyone blamed the victim for bringing it upon themselves, and it was downright wrong.<br />
The protests trying to spread correct information then were swept under the rug, deemed unnecessary because people thought they were hearing the full story. People both stating opinions and facts were in a war with police officers who were there to serve and protect. Free speech though, right?</p>
<p>Yet over in France, everyone sided with the one harassing people who, admittedly, face a lot of discrimination already, France does not allow hijabs or similar cultural headdresses to be worn in public, making it punishable by law for observing their own culture.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not saying the taking of a life is ever justified, but the massive reaction siding with a hate-fueled magazine was completely unjustified. </p>
<p>When a mass shooting of schoolchildren or innocent bystanders is perpetrated by a young white man, he is ‘troubled’ or ‘mentally ill.’ But if the race and religion were anything else, the killer would be torn apart by the media, and an immediate backlash would occur against the religion/race of that individual, exhibited by the Charlie Hebdo situation.</p>
<p>I may sound like a broken record, but honestly so does the news, nothing is getting fixed. It’s tiring to hear over and over.</p>
<p>And it is the Charlie Hebdo mentality that is to blame. This shock humor made to offend, past its annoying, 7th grade-esque face value, is really about maintaining a sort of system, a status quo left unrealized. And I think we can do so much better than that.</p>
<p>Things can only get better, hopefully, little by little. There will always be people wary of injustices, and we should know we can do better, and be better. We deserve better. Until America achieves that ominous “liberty and justice for all.” Why only focus on the First Amendment?</p>
<p>But hey, this is just my opinion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guillermo del Toro set his ambitions high when he began producing Book of Life. Several studios turned down the concept because it was a movie about the Mexican holiday Dia de Los Muertos set in, you know, Mexico, whose holidays are not so often seen in the mainstream media, which led to hesitance on the part of the producers. But Guillermo del Toro was persistent in getting his idea off the ground.<br />
Now, after a decade in the works, the movie has hit theaters,<br />
And it. Is. Fantastic.<br />
It captures just how alive this day of the dead really is, showing traditions and beliefs in a cartoony and happy setting, which is exactly how it is meant to be. The animation is whimsical and bright, much like the decorations usually seen during Dia de Los Muertos. The afterlife depicted is one big, long party, and the dead celebrate alongside the living.<br />
And as cartoony as the characters may look, the story is far from two dimensional. The love story isn’t a carbon copy love triangle, it makes very clear who the real couple is in the trio of Maria, Manolo, and Joaquin. Maria and Manolo are very clearly in love, but Joaquin, son of the town hero following in his father’s footsteps, is also in love with Maria, and in the place of a usually pompous suitor, is a multifaceted character who is a pivotal point in the (fantastically written and even more fantastically performed) story.<br />
This trio makes the movie absolutely fantastic, showing more than one kind of relationship between men and women, something very refreshing in this era of love “triangles.”<br />
The writing is playful and witty, and above all, adorable.<br />
I’m definitely not one for love stories, but Diego Luna’s (Manolo’s) serenades melted my heart. The pop music given a Mexican border sound adds to the charm of the movie.<br />
If you aren’t drawn to the beautiful art, then go for the rich cultural background with an equally wonderful story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s scary feeling like you’re never going to be happy again. Any spark and any enjoyment you once had is just gone one day. You just wake up and realize you feel different. And when you realize it, you scramble to find it again, something to stimulate you, or any feeling at all.</p>
<p>Depression can make small things big, like lighthearted comment leaving a huge emotional impact, secretly confirming a secret insecurity. Depression can also make big things small, like brushing aside dark thoughts, your brain telling you “You know, they really wouldn’t miss you. You annoy them anyways. If you can’t make yourself happy, why don’t you just do everyone else a favor?”</p>
<p>You lie awake at night, thinking about all the wrongs you may have done unto others, thinking about how you could’ve tried harder to keep everyone happy with you, they all hate you, probably. “You really aren’t worth it, you deserve to be miserable,” is all you can tell youself. “You’ll never be happy again.”</p>
<p>“You’re just being too sensitive. You’re too weak, not strong enough to stay here anymore,” you tell yourself over and over, when your mind should be on other things.</p>
<p>You can’t stop thinking, about what you don’t like about yourself, about how much easier it would be to end it, how grateful everyone would be to you.</p>
<p>You think you’re a waste of space and time, and no, this isn’t the occasional feeling you get when you’re down. This stays for weeks and weeks and that turns into months.</p>
<p>And you’re always, ALWAYS thinking. You can’t stop. Not even to sleep or go to a movie with friends.</p>
<p>Sometimes you take it out on yourself, finding anything that burns or cuts you on the outside, taking it to your skin, over and over, until you’re numb. Anything to give you any form of sensation or release. It becomes hard to feel and be affected by things.</p>
<p>You don’t want to go out anymore. You’re a joke to everyone. Even pain inflicted upon yourself doesn’t let you feel anything.</p>
<p>You get to a point where you don’t want to move. You can’t cry anymore. You’ve given up, you’re so disappointed in yourself. Everybody was always tells you to get over it, but you can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>To yourself, you&#8217;re broken, a freak. Every negative comment and thought has been retained and repeated back, amplified. Everything they say about you must be based in truth, right? You agree with them, anything they say to you.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just, uncomfortable, being yourself, feeling how you&#8217;re feeling. You feel crazy. You cry out of the frustration just a normal day give you. You’re just so frustrated that you just can’t be happy. You can’t stand yourself. You have no right to be this unhappy.</p>
<p>But the reality of it is, you physically can’t help it.</p>
<p>Depression is a disease, not an emotion. Many people don’t realize its severity until its too late, and even then, many are left with questions.</p>
<p>A person is not selfish for being affected by depression, or losing to it. To take your own life takes a lot of thought about everyone in your life, and is not selfish. It isn’t selfish to reach out either, everybody deserves help.</p>
<p>Depression, despite common belief, is not just being sad, or having a bad day. It is based in the chemistry of the brain, physically hindering a person&#8217;s happiness.</p>
<p>Telling someone “it’s all in your head” isn’t going to make it any better or any easier, it won’t magically cure a person if all you say is “cheer up.”</p>
<p>If somebody tells you they&#8217;re feeling anything even close to this, GET THEM HELP.</p>
<p>If you feel anything similar to this, GET HELP.</p>
<p>It can be helped, no matter how terrible you feel, you can hang on a little longer.</p>
<p>You deserve to feel happy again, and just as you began to feel depressed, you can begin to recover as well.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re stronger than you think you are, you can be helped.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Depression is a mental disorder which leaves a person feeling unsatisfied, despondent, and sad for long periods of time. According to the Mayo Clinic, depression can be caused by a physical or chemical imbalance in the brain, as well as genetics and emotional trauma. All of these out of a person’s control.</p>
<p>Depression is never the fault of those affected, it is not something they choose. Depression is also extremely common among teens and young adults and those who abuse substances. Also those who suffer from clinical anxiety, (no not being worried before a test, but REAL anxiety,) as the two mental illnesses often go hand in hand with one another.</p>
<p>And just as depression can stem from anxiety, it can go the other way. Some of the more common results of depression include anxiety as well as weight change, difficulty in school, work, and social isolation.</p>
<p>In more extreme and untreated cases of depression, some turn towards substance abuse and other forms of self mutilation. This is used as a form of escape for some people, a sort of release. For some it’s the only thing they can feel.</p>
<p>Some common warning signs for depression include (from the Mayo Clinic):</p>
<ul>
<li>Feelings of sadness, emptiness or unhappiness</li>
<li>Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters</li>
<li>Loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, such as sex</li>
<li>Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much</li>
<li>Tiredness and lack of energy, so that even small tasks take extra effort</li>
<li>Changes in appetite — often reduced appetite and weight loss, but increased cravings for food and weight gain in some people</li>
<li>Anxiety, agitation or restlessness — for example, excessive worrying, pacing, hand-wringing or an inability to sit still</li>
<li>Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements</li>
<li>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or blaming yourself for things that are not your responsibility</li>
<li>Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things</li>
<li>Frequent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide</li>
<li>Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also several types of depression, such as seasonal depression, and anxious distress depression. Some types of depression can be accompanied with things ranging from hallucinations to involuntary movements.</p>
<p>If you experience any of the above symptoms, get immediate help. Set up an appointment with your family doctor to be referred to a therapist. Even talking to the school counselor is a good start.</p>
<p>If you feel you may have depression, take note of your symptoms for reference during your first visit. Also take into account familial history, your current situation, any events that may have triggered this, and even a medicine you started. All could be a legitimate cause of depression.</p>
<p>Seek immediate attention if you feel suicidal, or even begin to contemplate suicide. Call an emergency hotline or find another form of emergency service.</p>
<p>Depression can be worked through gradually with persistence, it is hard, but always worth it.</p>
<p>Listen to your doctor, take notes, be actively involved in resolving your depression. It is extremely difficult, but having a good support system behind you is always a good idea.</p>
<p>Treatments can include medication (like with any other disease,) and therapy, or a mixture of both.</p>
<p>If your friend or someone you know shows these symptoms, seek help for them. Talk to them. And most importantly; listen to them. Don’t just tell them to cheer up or put their mind on other things, as this does nothing to help. Do not blame them. Be supportive and recognize their problems, and offer to help them work through their depression.</p>
<p>Depression does not have to be faced alone. The suicide hotline can be found at 1-800-273-TALK, and crisistextline.org can also be helpful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Following in the footsteps of Kansas and Arizona, Mississippi now plans to legalize discrimination.</p>
<p>Lately businesses and employees want ‘the right’ to refuse service to openly queer individuals simply on religious grounds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They say this is like Muslim employees having the right to not handle beef, when in reality it’s more like a Jewish employee not doing their job just because a person walked in with a hotdog shirt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When faced with any criticism these ‘supporters’ get defensive, even trying to play the completely made up ‘reverse discrimination’ card.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I say completely fake because it is. In no way can oppressive people be oppressed. They hold no political/social power because these are held by oppressors. They’re being called out on their behavior and they can’t take it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the words of this online commenter on this article: “Christians especially need special protection under the law now. They are being threatened with prison and bankruptcy for not supporting homosexual events when ordered to do so by homosexuals. Time to put Christians under civil rights protection,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">So somehow not being legally protected to harass someone is now a punishable offence in their eyes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The threat of bankruptcy comes from the ‘Christian’ business owner’s own problems with people, not the other way around.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I don’t understand how the queer identity of someone else could have such a negative effect on someone that they feel the need to legally take away their feeling of security in places of business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People claim that they do this in the name of their religion, but in reality, they’re just being selfish.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Your personality is open to criticism if it dares to show itself. Any ideas can be devalued immediately because of who you are. On several occasions I’ve been devalued online and in person for my opinions just because I’m female.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To this day women are limited in their personalities and role in society. Women are still told what to do by others because sexism and bigotry are still prevalent today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Women are told how to look by the media, given unrealistic expectations of beauty and are harassed if they are too big or small or short or tall or if their face doesn’t follow the same symmetry as another woman.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Women are constantly subjected to be in comparison of other women their whole lives. But what is the point of being beautiful? So you will appeal more to men, because that determines your worth apparently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Being locked into place by societal standards is all too much for young women, leading to unhealthy thinking and thoughts that they aren’t worth anything just because society said they weren’t.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They are told their place and expected to stay there, like a trained animal instead of a human being. Self-respect is definitely the determining factor of who you are, not what society tells you to be.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ambition shouldn’t be stifled due to being called “selfish.” Having a family should be your choice. How you dress should be your choice. What and who you like are entirely up to you, and shouldn’t be criticized by anyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Every time I’ve told someone that I don’t plan on getting married or having children, they tell me “you’ll change your mind” even though I really don’t want kids. I don’t want a child to care for but that doesn’t make me selfish, that just means I have a different plan in life than what other people have seemingly decided for me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t tell me sexism doesn’t exist just because I can vote. Sexism won’t exist when I can express ideas and make my own choices without being talked down to or asked if I’m on my period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Before:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1) Prevent your parents from finding out if possible: Try to intercept any messages and progress reports. Burning is a permanent solution to this problematic evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">2) Do extra chores around the house: Or at least ask if they need help more often. Become their favorite child by acting better than your siblings; if you’re an only child, be nicer than the dog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">3) Pretend to spend copious amounts of time on homework: Tears are a good tool to make your parents feel bad for you. Ask for lots of help, which they can’t give because high school was forever ago for them. Remember to promise you’ll get the teacher’s help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">4) Remind them that you’re trying your hardest: After all if you’re failing the teacher must be mean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">After:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1) Apologize: Profusely. Promise to try harder and/or ask the teacher for more help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">2) Say you’ll make up all late work: It’s advisable to actually follow through with this one, so you can avoid future situations like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">3) Take it like a man: If you’re grounded, you’re grounded, just go willingly to make the punishment less brutal. Crocodile tears also help lessen the blows (if you’re a good actor).</p>
<p>4) Try harder in school: For real, the stress of bad grades is more painful than the stress of daily school work and effort in class.</p>
