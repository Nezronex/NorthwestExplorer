										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Workin&#8217; 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin&#8217;” may stand true in the workforce but, for some students, that time can be applied to school. </p>
<p>Senior Tamatha Vaughn is one of these students. She find herself at Northwest in the early morning and going into the afternoon, sometimes even leaving after the sun has gone down. Her reason for staying? Choir. </p>
<p>“Tamatha is my vice president of the choir concert, so she helps me a lot with the events we do and with our choreography,” senior Angelyn Montanez said. “We usually allow a senior to handle our choreography and Tamatha has taken on that this year.”</p>
<p>Vaughn has been credited with the flashmob, the dance done on their homecoming parade float, and is expected to choreograph some of the dances in Bearlesque this year. </p>
<p>“I think she should have done more in the past,” Montanez said. “People like her dance moves a lot more than some of the other people who have done them. They’re a lot more fun and she actually is one of our really fun instructors. She’s really strict but yet she’ll bring a smile to your face and make dancing fun for everyone.”</p>
<p>Vaughn enjoys what she does, but sometimes experiences “dancer block” which can lead to her having trouble thinking of the moves she needs to create the idea given to her by Mrs. Brown. </p>
<p>Her skilled dancing and experience in choreography comes from years of practice. Vaughn has performed local shows as a part of a dance group called POSE at clubs, festivals, and events such as a hair show at ABODE. Before joining her POSE, she used to dance in a studio for 14 years. It was there she competed in tap, jazz, ballet, hip-hop, and several other dance genres. </p>
<p>“I was at that studio four, five days out of the week for a couple hours each. You could say I’m dedicated,” Vaughn said. “I do a lot of it [dance] all the time. Especially now that we don’t do a lot of shows with the group, I still like working on stuff for Bearlesque and choir, I just do extra stuff to get me to do dance and focus on dance.”</p>
<p>Her group isn’t as active anymore, but they still get together and talk about events if they’re really interested in participating. For now, she’s using her experiences to prepare herself for her future goals. </p>
<p>“At first it was the whole famous thing ‘I wanna be a known choreographer’ and ‘I want to do this and that’ and ‘I wanna be in music videos’. But now it’s changed, I want to help the little girls, teach them and maybe they can grow up and go be the stars,” Vaughn said. “I wanna give them the motivation and love I have for dance. I want them to be able to strive for their dreams and I just want to be the person that’s standing behind them and pushing them just a little bit, you know? Working them hard. That’s what happened to me.”</p>
<p>Vaughn’s change of heart came about a few months before senior year after walking into a studio and seeing a group of little girls learning how to dance. She enjoys performing and being on stage and wouldn’t hesitate to jump at the opportunity for her famous aspirations. </p>
<p>“I just want to be more behind the scenes now,” Vaughn said, “I just want to be their inspiration for wanting to go off and do the big things.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Northwest students joined several other teams from Wichita Public schools to compete in a cooking competition on Jan. 27 at South High. </p>
<p>Junior Autumn O’Conner and senior Marcus Wooley decided to step up after their culinary class was prompted for the competition. The goal? Create a delicious, nutritious school lunch for the enjoyment of their peers. </p>
<p>“We had made enchiladas and our fruit and a vegetable side dish,” O’Conner said, “The fruit had kiwi, oranges, cinnamon, and granola mixed into it. Our vegetable dish was a bean cilantro. Mostly everyone liked it, but we didn’t come in first place.” </p>
<p>The students had to have some food purchased for them and provided with pre-cooked hamburger meat before their meal was prepared and presented before a group of judges. The winners of this competition would receive a paid trip to Washington D.C. and have their food  incorporated into the school food. </p>
<p>“Our next competition will be with the whole entire state,” O’Conner said, “We’ll be going to a hotel, and we designed our own restaurant that’s called the Royal Soul Food and it has a bakery in it.”<br />
According to culinary instructor Alison Draut, O’Conner, Wooley, sophomore Cheyanne Sanders, and junior Haleigh Lovings will be participating in two competitions: management and edible garnish. For the management competition, students will be presenting a restaurant before a panel of judges which can range from business owners to chefs from universities. The edible garnish competition will have students sculpting things like dinosaurs, or flowers, from fruit.  </p>
<p>“I’m preparing by taking it on as if I was really opening one [a restaurant],” Wooley said, “so I called all the places and I’m so, ready. I can’t even explain how ready I am for this.” </p>
<p>The two will participate March 3 and 4 with students from all over the state of Kansas. </p>
<p>“It’s not all about winning,” O’Conner said, “that was a small competition this one this one is going to be a whole lot bigger and we want to show our school.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are 24 hours in the day, at least seven required to spend at school, and, according to scientists, nine hours of sleep are required for teenage brains. If you’re in sports, extracurriculars, have a job, or just need to keep up the social aspects of your life, that’d leave you with eight hours to spend on those activities, before you’d be required to cut into your sleep. </p>
<p>For Alyssa Hershey, time can appear crunched at times, and on some days, it’s a matter of choosing.  </p>
<p>Hershey is involved in several things, both in and out of school. Being involved in several shows at Music Theater for Young People (MTYP), Music Theater Wichita (MTW) and Wichita Children’s Theater &#038; dance Center (WTC &#038; DC) on top of school, higher level classes, church, band and even dance classes has lead to her having a jam-packed schedule.  </p>
<p>“It just kinda depends on what’s going on,” Hershey said, “Like how much is going on at that point. Right now, I’m handling it pretty well. A couple weeks ago, though, I was at a breaking point. AP classes, and end of the nine weeks, and being in two shows&#8211; it can just&#8211; it can get really tough.” </p>
<p>The current D and F list policies doesn’t affect Hershey due to her lack of participation in school sports, however her grades and extracurriculars such as: band, symphony, two dance classes, church Wednesday and Sunday, plus three advanced courses, can often lead her to having to make hard decisions and sacrificing things to find that balance. A few weeks back she had several shows and events packed into her short week, and found herself on the edge constantly. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t really sleeping that much, there was a few days in there where I didn’t sleep at all. It was really healthy,” Hershey said, “There were two nights where I pulled two all nighters in a row and I was just always doing something. Right after school I’d be in rehearsals until late and then I’d go straight home and do homework and just eat on the way. Then I’d be up all night doing homework and the next day I’d be doing it all over again. There was a couple times where I almost had a meltdown.”</p>
<p>Although Hershey doesn’t have to worry about not being able to perform if her grades dip down into the lower levels, not all students are as lucky. Business teacher Jeff Darr believes that it’s all a matter of finding a balance, which can be hard with all the things offered at Northwest, and even more so after they added an extra hour a couple years ago. </p>
<p>“There is a point that we need to, as administrators and teachers, I think we need to at least look at the number of classes that we changed two years ago. we went from seven periods to eight periods in terms of classes that students could potentially have projects, homeworks, tests, and things of that nature.” </p>
<p>Principle Alverez believes the D and F list is a good change for Northwest and thinks it should be seen as a positive thing. He wants it to be something to keep students, and teachers aware and seeking help if they need it. </p>
<p>“I think the D and f list was meant to be more of an awareness, not a punishment. The list came about because our athletic teams wanted to have a code of conduct that was tied into the d and f list that tied into the students grades. You had to have several ds and fs before you had your first warning week and after that week if it didn’t come up then there were consequences rather it be no playing time or what not. I think everybody thought that you could only have one D or F but that’s not the case, the case is we’re trying to get students into torturing, in to see their teacher&#8211; We’re trying to make it student friendly and not just a complete punishment.”</p>
<p>Junior Taylor Webber counters. </p>
<p>“Basically it comes down to you can not have a social life, good grades, play a sport, have a job, and get sleep. It’s impossible. How am I supposed to do my homework if I only get two hours of sleep? “</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several Northwest students attended an all-day competition at Newman University for DECA and 26 returned placing in the top 5.</p>
<p>Wichita Area DECA competition (WADECA) took place on Oct. 16 and had several categories for students to compete in. Senior Malcolm Graham competed in Automotive Services Marketing and was one of four students who returned with first place.  </p>
<p>“Basically you pick an area of business you want to compete in and you&#8217;re given a scenario&#8211; a roleplay&#8211; where you act like you’re pitching an idea,” Graham said, “And then you go after that and take a test.”</p>
<p>DECA students will have other competitions to participate in later in the year, but this competition does not determine their eligibility to compete. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t really mean anything,” Graham said, “it’s just a ‘hey you did a good job’ sort of thing. It’s just a practice.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Student athletes participating in fall sports for this year found themselves required to sign the Code of Player Conduct.</p>
<p>The Code of Player Conduct was created after last year’s accreditation process and was put in place to hold student athletes accountable for their grades. It states “If a student/athlete has any combination of 3 D’s and/or F’s there may be consequences. Consequences begin Tuesday of each week.”</p>
<p>There are mixed feelings about the requirements from students and some are more aware than others of the new rule that states that any combination of 3 D’s or F’s, will leave them ineligible to practice or play.</p>
<p>But it isn’t intended to be a punishment according to athletic director Lance Deckinger. He says it is a way to help students and their parents be more aware.</p>
<p>“It just helps out the coaches and makes it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades,” Deckinger said. “We’re holding the kids accountable and have had a couple comments even from parents like ‘I didn’t even know my kid had these grades,’ and it helps everyone keep an eye on what’s important.”</p>
<p>Deckinger says the first week is a warning week to let athletes know they need to improve their grades.</p>
<p>“If you’re on it a second week, we’ll see which direction your grades are going,” Deckinger said, “and if they’re going in the wrong direction you’re not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, then you can keep on playing.”</p>
<p>Some students have already felt the effects of the new requirements, but aren’t too upset. They just find themselves rushing to get things done so they can participate and support their team.</p>
<p>“The list affects the soccer team because if you don’t keep your grades up&#8230; the team’s going to be one player down and they won’t be complete,” sophomore Jesus Morales said.</p>
<p>“I had to miss one game. [Before] next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.”</p>
<p>Students are well aware of the requirements for their grades, but fail to realize that absences can also define whether you play or not.</p>
<p>According to the Code of Conduct, students must be in school to participate in a game or practice. If a student is excused for more than half of the day they are not allowed to participate in a practice and/or game.</p>
<p>“They send it [the list] out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that’s always been a problem of knowing whether they’re here or not,” cheer coach Tiffany Houle said. “If they’re not here that means no practice and no games.”</p>
<p><strong><strong></p>
<p></strong></strong></p>
<p>Absences, however, are also now defining whether you can participate or not.</p>
<p>“The D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.”</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“The list affects the soccer team because if you don’t keep your grades up you won’t play. The team’s going to be one player down and they won’t be complete,” said sophomore  Jesus Morales. “I was on the D &amp; F list and I had to miss one game. (Before) next game I had to hurry and turn in all my work. It was hard but it was worth it because in the end I got to play and we got the win.”</p>
<p>“The D and F list is to help students make sure they are here and doing what they are supposed to and make sure that their education goes first.”</p>
<p>WE STARTED HAVING A D F LIST THIS YEAR. JUST MAKING SURE WE’VE HAD STUDENTS IN THE PAST THAT WEREN’T ALWAYS PASSING CLASSES</p>
<p>AND IT’S JUST IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU’RE PASSING YOUR  CLASSES. AND DOING WHAT YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING HERE FOR YOUR EDUCATION BEFORE YOU’RE DOING EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY.</p>
<p>THE FIRST WEEK IS SORTA A WARNING WEEK, hey you got some grades down, get your grades up. IF YOU’RE ON IT A SECOND WEEK WE’LL SEE WHICH DIRECTION YOUR GRADES ARE GOING and if they’re going to wrong direction, hey go get your grades up, your’e not kicked off the team. You just need to improve, and then you can keep playing.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>You shouldn’t probably be participating in co-curricular activities If you’re having three or four ds or fs. So that’s what started the list, so coaches and students could keep up with it. Because in the past when they had 4 5 ds and fs, they really shouldn’t be on the field</p>
<p>Everyone just got on the same page and said it’s time to start improving it.</p>
<p>when we had our accreditation this past year, every five years they have the accreditation, one of the things that came up was students, people who have low grades participating in co-curricular activities, why are these students, if they’re having low grades, out there when they can’t take care of their grades.</p>
<p>It’s helped out the coaches and made it easier for coaches and students keep an eye, at least, on their grades. Holding the kids accountable and we’ve had a couple comments even from parents like ‘I didn’t even my kid had these grades’ and it helps everyone keep an eye on what’s important.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Yes it is helpful because I don’t have to look it up myself, they send it out to me and I really like the attendance list, because that’s always been a problem of knowing whether they’re here or not. So I like that they send an attendance list every day so we know if they’re in school. So if they’re not here that means no practice, no games, which is nice because like I said, I used to have to look it up individually but now I don’t have to do that because every week I’m getting a list and I only have to find the girls that are getting Ds or Fs</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>“ I’m not a big fan, but you gotta do what you gotta do. To me it’s just more paperwork that gets in the way of things. Is the concept good? Yes. Does it hold athletes to a higher standard? Yes. But we had less than one percent of athletes that have physicals turned in have issues with grades so I didn’t really think it was necessary.” said Cross Country coach Ron Russel</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kurt Cobain. Heath Ledger. Whitney Houston. Robin Williams. At least one of these names will register in your mind, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they all did. The four listed above have made their marks on the world, but their fame isn’t the only similarity that runs between them.</p>
<p>With the recent death of Robin Williams, the topic of depression has been discussed by word of mouth, school assignments, and on the news. The death of the beloved actor came as a shock, many people not even aware that the man, who was seen by friends, co-stars, and fans as one of the happiest people on earth, had depression.</p>
<p>But that’s a common theme with depression, typically depressed people are depicted as being bed-ridden and incapable of functioning, but in reality people can smile, function, and seem as if they’re going about day-to-day life without a hitch. According to Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA), experts estimate that 5% of all teenagers will suffer from depression. Unfortunately, only 20% of depressed teens are appropriately diagnosed and treated. Meaning that of our estimated 1,400 adolescents, 70 of our students will be diagnosed with depression, and 14 of them will go untreated. That’s merely in our school alone.</p>
<p>It’s very important for students in various situations to understand that they are not alone, but even more so when they’re finding themselves feeling depressed. Remember that you’re important, that people care about you, and you can reach out and look for the help you need. It isn’t your job to pretend to be happy, but rather find the resources to help make yourself happy.</p>
<p>As students of Northwest, we should take our Pride, Excellence, and Respect to the next step and try to understand that depression is a disease. It’s not someone having a bad day, it isn’t someone upset because of “something small”, and it most definitely isn’t something they’re merely whining about and need to “get over it”. &nbsp;It’s real, it’s harmful, and it can hurt them on multiple levels. Offer a shoulder for them to lean on, an ear for them to talk to, or a place for them to go when they think they have no where else. Because sometimes, a person them up when they’re down is all they need to start seeking the help they need.</p>
<p>If you feel depressed, helpless, upset, or just as if the world is against you at any point and time, there are several resources you can use to your advantage. First and foremost, talk to someone you trust; a parent, guardian, counselor, teacher, or friend, they all have resources and care about you, they’ll want to help. There is also several websites that allow you to seek the advice and words of people from all over the world such as the <a href="http://thequietplaceproject.com/">http://thequietplaceproject.com/</a>, which is a site that has various tools to help you vent and release any negative thoughts or emotions. Finally, should you find yourself in a particularly dark place, the suicide hotline is always in operation, and easy to access. Simply dial &nbsp;1-800-273-TALK (8255) to be connected to an operator who will listen to your current situation and help to the best of their abilities.</p>
<p>Remember, Grizzlies that this is a disease, not a choice, and you must attempt to respect, understand, and help those around you, and that seek your help.</p>
<p><strong>That way, you are never alone. </strong></p>

<li>Respect authority, rules, peers, and staff. You’re only at school for seven hours, you can do it, promise.</li>
<li>Taking lots of notes helps out in the end. Even with how annoying and boring it is taking lots of notes, it makes it easier to study, especially for finals.</li>
<li>Remember, you aren&#8217;t alone. There are hundreds of teens experiencing what you are and you’re surrounded by peers, upperclassmen, and staff that will help you if you ask!</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to make new friends. High school is your “fresh start”. Go in with a good attitude, turn things in, get involved, and make memories with the people around you.</li>
<li>Get involved. It helps the year go by faster and helps your high school years seem like more than just books and work.</li>
<li>Voice any questions you have to other students or staff. Questions are there to be answered, and that’s the point of school: to gain the information you need.</li>
<li>Do your homework. It might seem like busy work, but it actually helps you retain the information.</li>
<li>Procrastinating. As great as it sounds to sit back and watch Netflix rather than doing your homework, it’s better to get things done early rather than waiting till the last minute to get it done.</li>
<li>Get to class. Or rather, don’t stand in the middle of the halls and take up space to talk to your friends. If you have to do that move to the side so people can get around you.</li>
<li>Watch the attitude, this is something that ties in with respect. You might think you’re top-dog, but you’re not, and it’s important to watch what you say. You might think you’re all-that-and-a-bag-of-chips, but, once again, you’re not. It really pays off to take a breather and respect the person you’re talking to.</li>
<li>Remember you’re all in the same boat, everyone has been. Popularity isn’t important, so don’t worry about how you look in the eyes of others. Be confident and get things done.</li>
<li>Don’t sweat it. If you’re having a rough time or getting stressed, take a breather. Go off and play a game for 30 minutes, rant to your best friend, read a book&#8211; do something that helps you relax and then reevaluate the problem.<br />
That essay’s important, but so is your mental and physical health!</li>
<li>Get involved! Attend assemblies, show your pride, be happy to be a grizzly. It makes the school a far better place.</li>
<li>Read the paper, keep up online, and follow our Twitter. It’s quality stuff, and one of the most important things in the school, obviously.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 dir="ltr">It&#8217;s time to make scholarships your focus!</h1>
<p dir="ltr">You can find opportunities through nonprofit organizations, and small and large companies. Ask your employer, your parent’s employer, and your church. You never know where an opportunity may exist.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What should you do?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Schedule time in your week to work on scholarship applications. It can quickly feel overwhelming, so take a look at your schedule and plug it in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Utilize websites to find scholarships some examples being:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cappex.com/">www.cappex.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.studentscholarships.org/">www.studentscholarships.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.fastweb.com/">www.fastweb.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>(Make sure you don’t pay anyone or any site a fee for scholarships. That can be a sign of a scam.)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Check out your community colleges.</strong> Most community colleges offer activity scholarships that can pay up to books and tuition. Activities may include athletics, music, drama, yearbook, newspaper, photography, writing, being a student ambassador, or being a leader! Attend a community college and receive your first couple of years of college for close to free!</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Anything else?</h2>
<ul>

<li> You can also feel free to stop by the CCC to discuss your plans and see what scholarships you may qualify for, passes can be given by Danea Cramer in A-26 for advocacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow the CCC @nw_ccc on Twitter for all of the latest information related to life after high school. </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 dir="ltr">Scholarship Information</h1>
<h3 dir="ltr">Upcoming Scholarships Deadlines:</h3>
<ul>
<li>November 1 – KSU and KU</li>
<li>November 15 – FHSU</li>
</ul>
<p>To find additional scholarship opportunities consider creating an account at any of the following sites, each provide FREE scholarship searches for you!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cappex.com/">www.cappex.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.studentscholarships.org/">www.studentscholarships.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zinch.com/">www.zinch.com</a></li>
<li>Scholarships can also be found on the CCC fusionpage.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><em>You must apply for admission and be accepted to qualify for scholarships. This is done by applying for admission, paying the application fee and sending your transcript and ACT scores.</em></p>
<h1 dir="ltr">The ACT</h1>
<h3 dir="ltr">Deadlines and Dates</h3>
<ul>
<li>The deadline for the December 14 ACT is Friday, November 8.</li>
<li>WSU will be hosting an ACT Prep Workshop on November 16. The cost is $32. Register on-line at <a href="http://www.registerblast.com/wsu">www.registerblast.com/wsu</a>.</li>
<li>The CCC will be hosting an ACT Prep Workshop on Monday, December 2 during Advocacy. Sign-up in the CCC.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">ACT Reminders</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select colleges that you want  to receive your ACT scores and make sure to upload your photo when registering.</li>
<li>There is an app for iPhones, iPads, and Android devices that allows you upload your picture in less than a minute. If you prefer, you can stop by the CCC in A-26 and upload it there.</li>
<li>When you register for the ACT it is extremely important to select the colleges you want to see your scores, as ACT scores will no longer appear on your transcript, so therefore Northwest can no longer send them to colleges for you.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t choose the colleges you want to receive your scores, you will pay $13 for each score report to be sent to colleges. <em>That will get expensive quickly.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">College Visits</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
If you have not visited colleges that you are interested in, now is the time to do that. Visiting campus allow you get a “feel” for the environment of the college. For many students, the campus visit is the deciding factor on whether or not they attend that college. When scheduling the visit, make sure to give the college two weeks notice that your requests can be made. You can choose to tour the campus, see the residence halls, meet with a professor, speak with financial aid, etc. You can make it how you want it.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Career Fits</h1>
<h3>Struggling to figure out your career fit? Check out these websites for personality &amp; career assessments.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Holland Code Assessment. The Holland Code theory explains work-related behavior such as, which career choices are likely to lead to job success and satisfaction. It also explains other human actions, like success and satisfaction in school and training programs.<br />
<a href="http://personality-testing.info/tests/RIASEC.php">http://personality-testing.info/tests/RIASEC.php</a></li>
<li>The O-NET interest profiler can help you figure out your interests are and how they relate to the world of work. You can find out what you like to do utilizing this profiler.<br />
<a href="http://www.mynextmove.org/">www.mynextmove.org</a></li>
</ul>
