										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long tradition of prom being held at the Cotillion, there are expected changes to come in 2015. This year’s prom is going to held at the Scottish Rite Center located near downtown Wichita.</p>
<p>“We wanted a more updated, classier place. Really, it was spearheaded by Mr.Givens, being as he is the senior class principal, he wanted to have it somewhere nicer.” said junior class sponsor Brian Latta.</p>
<p>The Scottish Rite building is cheaper to rent than The Cotillion. The Cotillion was $2,000 to rent with an additional 3 dollars per person, totaling at $3,600. The Scottish Rite Center is about $2,700 after additional charges. Including the DJ and decorations, prom is estimated to cost around $7,000. This years decorations are being made by the Northwest Stagecraft; they will receive payment for their contributions.<br />
“I think we spent a little more money last year on the overall prom decorations so we are actually starting off with less money than we have in the past. “ junior class sponsor Angela Mcdonald said</p>
<p>Prom is being held on an earlier date due to the only other option at the Rite center being  Easter weekend. Other venues such as the Abode and the Indian Center were discussed, but considering their venue sizes and other amenities,  the Scottish Rite Center was the best option.<br />
Despite the change of venue, other traditions will remain. Following the lead of previous years, the junior class makes up the committee that will plan the event. The theme for this years prom will be Belle Noire, meaning “black elegance”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northwest’s first Lunch and Learn was held last Tuesday in the CCC. Nineteen students gathered to listen to Suzy Thompson talk about what it&#8217;s really like to be a physical therapist.</p>
<p>Lunch and Learn offers a look into possible career choices for students by bringing in various professionals to discuss the everyday details of their job.</p>
<p>During first lunch on each third Tuesday of the month, students may meet in the CCC to listen to these area professionals.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of students that may join. If the discussions are successful, more meetings may be scheduled.</p>
<p>“Ms.Terriere  and I really wanted to set up the chance for students to talk to someone that does a real job,” College Career Coordinator Danea Cramer  said . “Not read about it or talk to someone from human resources, but actually sit down and say ‘What’s your day like? When you go to work, what’s the first thing you do? How do you determine how to manage your day? Where did you go to college? Do you need to go to college to do this job?”</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning about a potential career, see Cramer in room A26.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>October- veterinarian</p>
<p>November- dental hygienist</p>
<p>December &#8211; engineer</p>
<p>January- nurse</p>
<p>February- optician</p>
<p>March- graphic designer</p>
<p>April- marketing/ finance manager</p>
<p>May- elementary school teacher</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a little more than a reunion for  &#8217;94 alumni Josh Herrman as he walks the halls of Northwest again. This time, instead of reminiscing over the times he had as a Grizzly, he&#8217;s working on plans to reconstruct the building.</p>
<p>After Herrman graduated he became an architect and has been apart of the remodel of multiple buildings in the Wichita area, including the Harley Davidson building and the new Northeast Magnet building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Walking into the school I noticed almost everything is the same. The commons are exactly the same, the only thing different is the color and arrangement of the lockers. The auditorium, the gym, it was all exactly the same,&#8221; Herrman said.</p>
<p>The buildings elements aren&#8217;t the only thing still a part of Northwest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ms.Pickert was my gym teacher and Mrs.Frentz from the E hall was also there when I was. Even some of the faculty is the same,&#8221; Herrman said.</p>
<p>Although our school is just another building with walls, windows and a few interior details here and there, it&#8217;s also the emblem of school pride to all grizzlies. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you enjoy school or not, the building itself will always stay remembered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope a sense of school pride will come from not only past but current and future grizzlies. This school has looked great for the last 40 years and we want to make it look great for the next 40,&#8221; Herrman said.</p>
<p>In order for Herrman and his team to remodel Northwest, there has to be more than just a few ideas, it requires a system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We put together a list of all the needs in the building and then we program the school with what isn&#8217;t there,&#8221; Herrman said. &#8220;We basically put together a schematic design plan, like a four plan. We look over it with all the faculty to figure out the best way to make it work. We have a good diagram but it may slightly change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remodeling of Northwest is definitely big deal and all the students and faculty should be glad to know it&#8217;s being taken care of by someone who thinks of the construction as more than just a job, but as a project to ignite the school spirit for all grizzlies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The personal connection I have with this job makes it better. My wife, my friends, some of my coworkers and myself all graduated from Northwest. I get excited with every building I work on and I want them to all come out great, but I kinda hope Northwest is extra good.”</p>

		<title>Northwest student Keaton O&#8217;Malia has future in hockey</title>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Living in Wichita, if you&#8217;re at all familiar with hockey, Thunder is a team you have probably heard about. Wichita Thunder hockey team has been playing in the CHL (Central Hockey League) since 1992, and has grown very popular in Wichita. Junior Keaton O’Malia has a dream of playing professionally one day, and he has started by joining the Thunder’s junior league.</p>
<p dir="ltr">O’Malia started playing hockey when he was 8 years old. He was inspired to play after his sister took him to his first  game, and has been hooked on the hockey life ever since.</p>
<p>Before he started playing he was interested in other sports, but once he began competing, that all changed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s always been a dream of mine to play professionally,” O’Malia said, “But I’ve been forced to look into other careers because you can’t play your whole life. I&#8217;m undecided on what career I want, but I do know I want to play for Notre Dame. I’ve always wanted to go and play there.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wichita Thunder’s junior league is a new team put together this year. The ages range from 16-21, and the average age for players is 19. O’Malia and one other player are the youngest&#8211;both being 16&#8211;currently playing, and the only ones that are still in high school. Playing on the team gives you the opportunity to be scouted by a college and continue on with the dream of playing professionally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I remember one of the guys who played [for Thunder] around 6-7 years ago: Travis Clayton. He has always been a role model to me when it comes to hockey. He’s now a coach for a team in my league and my team played his team not too long ago. I thought that was pretty cool,” O’Malia said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the past two years, O’Malia has become more dedicated to hockey than ever. He practices or plays everyday attempting to accomplish his dream.</p>
<p>“It’s important to work hard enough and maybe one day get a scholarship from it. It’s that inner drive, I guess,” O’Malia said.</p>
