										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since Naftzger Park was remodeled in 2018, it has served as a hangout destination for many Northwest Students. The park has many interesting aspects that make it worth going to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, the park has lights that light up the whole area. Second is the unique sitting areas it has to offer with moveable orange seats and many benches with tables. And even if you don&#8217;t like either of those options, sitting on the turf is also comfortable. Last is the light up stage for concerts and events that are held downtown. All of these aspects make it super fun and interactive for Northwest students. Saul Lingafelter goes to the park pretty frequently to socialize with all of his friends and catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like to go because my friends like to meet up there, and sometimes we ride our skateboards around the park,” said Lingafelter (12).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naftzger Park also has plenty of spots to eat at and shop in the surrounding area. A popular place to eat is Homegrown. Homegrown provides customers with breakfast food. More food establishments like Starbucks and Smoothie King are close by. Naftzger park is also near a Quiktrip and is the favorite place to eat for Anabelle Boyd.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ Me and my friends usually ride scooters or walk to Quiktrip. I like to go because everything is usually pretty cheap and it has a large variety of snacks.” said Boyd (11)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re looking for a chill spot to hangout with your friends, have a nice meal or even display a mini concert, Naftzger Park would be a great fit for you!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest students have always had an open variety of places to eat for each meal of the day. Simply going down Tyler road both ways will greet you with many options for food.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest selling some of its land has made a lot of opportunities for businesses to strive in the food industry. Selling some of the land off has turned into the acquisition of Hardees, Quiktrip and other successful businesses. The most recent acquisition, HteaO has been a hit for Northwest students. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Watermelon tea smacks” Damon Wilson, said when asked about his favorite beverage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the huge selection of tea and even lemonade has led the business to be busy due to the kids going there. Htea0’s happy hour starts at two and ends at four, which is a perfect time for students to get a quick drink after school. Stay hydrated grizzlies!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest the past couple of years have had a good group of wide receivers to throw to. With many receivers leaving, others have had to step up. The Northwest receiver core is expected to be explosive and show signs of great speed. The receiving squad has built a nice core with many returning players expected to have bigger roles. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trenton Salisbury (11) has shown great potential and sees himself getting many reps and being a consistent target. Randall Bell (12) who used to play quarterback then switched to receiver is very excited for the new season.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“The way we’re able to adjust this year, and mess with the defense will make us really nice this year,” Bell stated when asked about his wide receiver group.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Michael Lopez, who is the receivers coach&#8217;s son, is expected to have a big role on the team this year. Many of his teammates have said his speed is incredible and has explosive acceleration. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kealis Miles has another bright spot in the receiving core. His broad body type and athletic skills will make him a force on the Grizzlies offense. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asking Miles some of his personal goals this year he stated “I want to overall become a better blocker for my teammates, so I can be as two dimensional as possible. And I want to have a reception each game of the season.” Miles is a great example of a team player and the Grizzlies are glad to have him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the season starting very soon, fans and students will be able to see all of what the receivers can put on the table.&nbsp;</span></p>
