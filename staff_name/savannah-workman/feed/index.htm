										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepping for college applications or making the dream sports team may be the next step for some after high school. Some students are not aware of the effect their online presence can have on their college plans.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students’ social media outputs can influence admission counselors or coaches to decline or revoke a scholarship because of what students  post on Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook. According to Kaplan Test Prep’s 2013 Survey, 30 percent of college admissions officers found something online about an applicant that negatively affected their application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why college career coordinator Danea Cramer cautions against posting questionable material.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you&#8217;re saying you are one thing on an application and then on social media you&#8217;re being inappropriate,” Cramer said “[colleges] probably won’t give that money to you because you&#8217;re not putting yourself in a very good light,” college career coordinator Danea Cramer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Northwest, head basketball coach Bryan Chadwick has a Twitter for the basketball team where coaches could have access to a player’s social media account. They will soon have an Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are just being smart, being proactive because you don&#8217;t want that stuff to catch up with you,” Chadwick said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For head football coach Steve Martin, reviewing a student&#8217;s account can occur when someone brings attention the the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those people and myself are looking at their profiles. I have had a parent or another teacher that follows a kid and says ‘hey coach, you might wanna look what this guy has on his profile’,” Martin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been parents that have brought attention to what their child or other student&#8217;s post. Online material considered inappropriate can range from violent to offensive posts or in relation of abusing drugs or alcohol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a strict drug policy here at Northwest when it comes to athletics,” Martin said. “Maybe they might not be a drug user or some of their friends might be, one of the big things is that they tie themselves into it just to try to be cool.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These actions affect everyone in other colleges around the U.S also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have seen it on ESPN  where college coaches have taken away scholarships. There was a kid out of Michigan. There was a kid out of Arkansas.They don’t want character issues,” Chadwick said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chadwick’s assertion is true. In 2012, football player Yuri Wright was expelled from Don Bosco Prep high School in Ramsey, N.J.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of racial and sexually graphic Twitter posts. He also lost  his scholarship to Michigan University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Putting a thought or feeling out there for everyone to see can lead to huge consequences. Junior Samantha Gould has found this out the hard way where she would soon learn to think about posting every thought or feeling on the internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would turn into a huge mess, Gould said. “I drifted away from a lot of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General admission for colleges sometimes do not look into students social media accounts.They just look to see if that student meets criteria, but if they are applying for a private college or a scholarship, they can choose to look up that student to see what they are posting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scholarship money is a gift,” Cramer said. “It&#8217;s nothing you have to pay back. So that can be anywhere from $250 to $2000 or more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin warns against risking this gift for likes or retweets, because mistakes online can be irreversible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Internet is a dictionary,” Martin said. “It&#8217;s an encyclopedia of your past.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Northwest , the 2015-16 school year has been a series of victories, from the football winning streak  to the bowling and scholars bowl teams. Included among these are the bowling and scholar’s bowl teams, both of which compete during the spring season, and both of which are setting records.</p>
<p>The boy’s [varsity] bowling team set three records ending in a win 29-52 Tuesday, Feb. 2 against Heights. The boys varsity bowling team’s highest one- and two- game series also set state records for the highest series ever bowled. The Junior varsity bowling team also placed in the top three in all of their tournaments.</p>
<p>“What sets us apart from other schools is that we have exceptional  coaches,” Latta said jokingly.</p>
<p>Latta is not the just the coach for bowling but for JV softball and scholar’s bowl as well. He took all of his teams to state.Scholar&#8217;s bowl hosted the regional tournament Feb. 4 and took first place.</p>
<p>“The tournaments, usually the first 15-30 minutes consists of gorging on whatever food they have provided. Usually it&#8217;s pizza,” senior scholar’s bowl member Chris Kliewer said.</p>
<p>Scholar’s bowl consists of 5 person teams that go against another school. They are asked 16 questions total, the first of which is  foreign language questions like French, German, and Spanish. Other subjects like language arts, social studies, science, mathematics, fine arts, and current events are included in the 16 questions.The first person who buzzes in and gets the question right receives ten points. The team with the most points at the end of that round wins.</p>
<p>“Scholar’s bowl is all about humor, keeping the kids up and involved,” Latta said. “During the school day, a lot of these kids that are in scholar&#8217;s bowl may not say two words, but when they get to the scholar&#8217;s bowl practice, they’re having the time of their lives.”</p>
<p>The commitment and time to coach two teams during the same season and to make them successful shows how committed these coaches are. To have a coach that brings students together and make them strive for excellence make it more fun to play a sport.</p>
<p>“ The dedication and the want, they want to be there they want to do it,” junior bowler Sam Kuns said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High school is about being prepared for college applications, being swamped with homework,  struggling to pull the eyelids back to stay awake in class, and in many cases, having a steady relationship with a significant other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But will that relationship really last after graduation?  Before going off to college, think about how the relationship is going. Is there tension? Will there be problems in the future?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to stageoflife.com, 60 percent of high schoolers (both male and female) plan to break up with their significant other when they leave for college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sacrifices for one’s partner can change a person; one can lose control of his or her life if so chooses to drop everything for that other person. This is all decided before couples graduate. How can someone look at a person with love and affection when thinking in the back of their head that the relationship may end?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parting ways may be the most difficult decision when goals in life are replaced with thinking about being by the significant other.  Having all of these hurdles of problems to jump over, yet the biggest one is determining life after high school. When getting out in the real world, people want someone to support them that isn’t their parents. Giving someone emotional support over the phone thousands of miles away only lasts for so long.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On yourtango.com though, not all high school relationships are destined to end. Robin Thicke and Paula Patton dated all the way through high school and college and got married in 2005. Five years later, they had their first son Julian. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People tend to change during college as a result of pressure from debt and loans, having a job, and difficult courses. When under intense pressure for deadlines, realizing who will be there for you when life gets stressful is an indicator of why to keep them around. Which will be affected immediately in college. Again, balancing that is challenging on its own. If you let the relationship breathe,then this causes to give each other room to grow and change into more mature people that balances checks and picking up kids from school.  Then all of the things that mattered in high school &#8212;  like matching color themes for homecoming &#8212; won’t matter as much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If people have the right mindset to be comfortable with the transitions from high school to college, then a relationship could work, instead of just being given up on altogether.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having patience and a reminder why you fell in love with that person will get you to see past the obstacles in the way. Also, stepping back and looking into the relationship before graduation can also change perspectives about the relationship. It can make you see and notice changes that can strengthen the relationship, or can wake you up and start focusing on yourself for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always have a future in mind, and keep the partner inside the heart for as long as possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My dad put a box into my sweaty hands when I got out of the car. It was labeled Pots and Pans on the side. I stop to take a look at the exterior of my new home Moving to start a new life after my parents’ divorce has been the most pivotal moment of my existence. As I stepped inside the house, I imagined how I would arrange my new room. Up to this point, it was still weird to not see my mom’s belongings packed up into boxes with our stuff. After unloading everything from the U-HAUL, I went to my room and unpacked my mountains of books. Meanwhile, I reminisced on my time at Maize Middle, my old house that had a broken wooden fence and dead grass surrounding it. In a short amount of time, it seemed I was moving into a completely different lifestyle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mom used to take pictures of my sister and I on our first day at school and all of us would go to McDonald’s afterwards to eat breakfast. Everything was peaceful. On the first day of 8th grade, I woke up late, so I sprinted to my dad&#8217;s car with a toothbrush in my mouth and one shoe on. Once I got to Wilbur, I was shocked to see no preppy kids. No need to be like everyone else. Nobody criticizing on how you looked or who you were friends with. I loved it. After a while, I made some pretty cool friends that understood what it was like to move from one dimension into a completely different world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time passed, I didn’t adjust well to not seeing my parents in the same room. I used to see them as one unit, watching me open my Christmas gifts or seeing them at volleyball games. I became uncomfortable with the notion that my parents would never get back together and that they were not meant to be. Overwhelmed, I didn&#8217;t want my parents to have their own house. To see one of my parents every other week. To be comfortable for that week, then have to pack my bag and just move to the next house. Constantly packing and unpacking, week after week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My dad noticed the toll that the constant packing was taking on me. He advised me to take a step back and not to look at the house, but to look at the people inside of it. He told me that whatever is going on in school or in the house, I can always talk to him; same with my mom. He showed me that I am able to open up the doors and unpack my mind and that in the end, it will all be ok. It won&#8217;t matter where I go. My family is my home, my dimension, no matter how many times I shift from one house to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My life changed for the better because I learned that it&#8217;s not the actual home that makes me feel at peace&#8211;it&#8217;s the people I share that home with.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I look out to the theatre,  I see hundreds of people furiously clapping for their children. The spotlight is all on the orchestra, it’s light is so blinding that I have to put my hand on my forehead to block the sunlight. I’m looking for my family in the never ending roar of whistles and hollering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find my dad first, he is clapping while holding a concert order sheet. Once we make eye contact, I light up and smile brighter. He returns my smile for a bigger one and whistles so loud that it echoes inside Century 2. To know that he is so proud of me makes me feel that I did the best job, and to know the crowds going crazy shows that the whole orchestra worked together to make music come to life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My right hand is gripping my cello, my blood is pounding from playing the last piece. This is the moment that I put everything on the line. How I play determines how loud of the clap or if the audience decides to stay in their seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 100 people in one room all working to achieve, learn, and to play until their fingers fall off brings me warmth and joy. The love I get back from my family after every concert brings tears to my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the holidays where we don’t have school or rehearsals, my family constantly brags about how great I am, but I was just one person contributing to making hundreds feel the music. Whether it be a slow waltz, or the pounding and repeating melody of Bach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The night before Christmas, my two cousins sing Christmas carols while I play my cello accompanying them. My family of thirty are all crowded in my grandma’s basement and singing along to the music like the Who’s in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the Grinch Stole Christmas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Playing Christmas music makes me feel excited and then I want to start tearing apart the wrapping paper covering up my gifts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notes are just notes on a page, but when you add an orchestra to play that sheet of paper, having it connect to the player and making that extra effort to give the audience that special story that they can connect to. Whether it be tales of sadness and pain, or laughter and playfulness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music doesn&#8217;t have to just be felt through classical music. Country music will want you to ride a tractor. Party music makes you want to get up, dance, or have a rave. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting to music in different ways and bringing emotion back into the world brings more warmth and joy than just words can express.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being in front of a crowd can be anxiety-inducing for many. Make that crowd a group of high school students whose priority is often times seeming ‘cool.’ This doesn’t bother sophomore Duncan Scriven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scriven is the founder and president of the Northwest Dance Club, and he puts himself in this situation every Tuesday and Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just go with it,” Scriven said. “It&#8217;s more a feeling of calmness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scriven was inspired to found the club after attending homecoming during freshman year. To this day, Scriven performs in large groups at homecoming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first homecoming I went to I loved,” Scriven said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His experience dancing has impacted him to where he steps out of his comfort zones and performs in front of large crowds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[I] love the energy,” Scriven said. “Usually I don’t function well under pressure, but I can most often tune everything out and focus on the music instead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scriven is a hands-on learner and teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m more of an ‘I’ll show you’ person,” Scriven said. “Everyone has a style of doing a certain move.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Garza and Lindsey Wiggins currently sponsor the club of 14-16 people, including Scriven. They meet on Tuesdays in Wiggins’ room and on Thursdays in Garza’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We just play different games and dance like at homecoming,” Scriven said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scriven often deals with students feigning interest in his club, but this doesn’t interfere with his love for dance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not really a matter of fitting in,” Scriven said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Crevoiserat [Crevo] is the new speech, debate, and English teacher this year. He is new to Northwest but not new to teaching, having taught at West for five years and Curtis Middle School for three years after that.</span></p>
<p>His transition to a new school has been easier than most.</p>
<p>“Any transition is tough because you have to get to know all of your different co-workers and your boss changes,” Crevo said. “Custodians are different. Just about everybody that you interact with is different so that is always challenging, but it has not been too hard here.”</p>
<p>Adjusting to Northwest and getting along with other teachers has been easy for Crevo because teachers here have been kind to him and very welcoming.</p>
<p>“Mr. Alvarez is very kind and accommodating,” Crevo said. “Everybody has been really. There are even some teachers or administrators from previous jobs in the district, including Mr. Henning who taught at West while I was there.”</p>
<p>His passion for English started when he was 14 years old.</p>
<p>“I just chose the major that I felt like I would be best at,&#8221; Crevo said. &#8220;My best subject was English so I decided to pursue that and then eventually that led me to teaching. I didn&#8217;t actually start out wanting to become a teacher; it&#8217;s something that I fell into once I decided that I really liked reading, learning about reading, and teaching other people how to read.”</p>
<p>The person that affected him most in the English world was his debate coach in high school, Pam McComas. His first teaching job was being an assistant coach alongside McComas.</p>
<p>“I travel with her almost every summer to the National Debate Tournaments in a different city each year,&#8221; Crevo said. &#8220;She has always told me that she thought I would be a great teacher from when I was a freshman in college up until the day I started teaching, and she is very happy that I have chosen this profession, that I have decided to be a debate coach.”</p>
<p>The changes from his old job to this school has made him notice different changes around his work area.</p>
<p>“I noticed that there was a lot more carpet and I noticed that the school layout is a bit different,&#8221; Crevo said. &#8220;I used to be in a two-story building when I taught middle school and now it is one story that has a central commons area with branches for the different hallways.”</p>
<p>His passions also branch out to &#8220;Netflix and chill&#8221; with his cats Rudy and Louie. His favorite kids TV show is &#8220;Adventure Time.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m one of those adults that are like ‘cartoons are cool!’ so I love &#8216;Adventure Time.&#8217; I have probably watched every single &#8216;Adventure Time.&#8217; It cheers me up if I&#8217;m ever having a bad day.” </span></p>
