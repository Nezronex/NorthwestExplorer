										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The feeling of buying something new can turn a person’s day around. After relying on this feeling for so long it can become an expensive habit. The world of a shopaholic can be a slippery slope into a ditch of denial and overspending that is hard to get out of. </p>
<p>Some Northwest students can relate to the overwhelming feeling of accomplishment when walking out of a store with more than one bag. Senior Riona Freeman knows that feeling well and now has trouble saving her money. “When I worked at a pizza place I saved a thousand dollars for a trip and now that I work in retail, I’m broke.”</p>
<p>Buying things for yourself is okay even if the total starts to add up, but spending that much every week or so may not be a good financial decision. “I like to shop at places like Forever 21 and Target,” said Sophomore Morgan Taylor, “I like to buy clothes, shoes and food.”<br />
Denial is one of the many steps to recovery.</p>
<p>“I usually get a $200 paycheck and then I spend it in like three days,” said Freeman. “I don&#8217;t really have any paychecks because I am a shopaholic, but I look good.”<br />
Acceptance is key; once realizing the initial problem of being a shopaholic, a person can move on to the next step of spending less.</p>
<p>Setting a budget is a good start to spending less and can be helpful tool in the future. There are two main tips to saving money that can be learned by taking a financial literacy class with Chris Lambert or Robin Bowman. </p>
<p>“We recommend that ten percent of each paycheck should go into savings,” Lambert said “and spend more money on your needs than your wants.”  </p>
<p>Another solution can be to set aside a certain amount of money before going shopping and only take that amount; then there’s no chance of overspending. If all else fails, you can contact Terrence Shulman, the founder of ShopaholicsAnonymous.org.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Headaches, sleep loss, and the overwhelming urge to cry: these are all lovely signs of being stressed. It’s now December and the clock is ticking, wrapping up yet another year. Only one semester left after Christmas break for us seniors and my drive to do anything is at a negative seventy-five. It’s the time where we get questioned on a daily basis where we want to go to college and what we want to study. The only answer I can seem to formulate to these questions though, is that I have absolutely no idea.<br />
After being told what to do or where to go for 17 years, I am now expected to just make a life changing decision before I even turn 18. For some, the decision is easy but for others like me, it’s not. I’m horrible at making decisions, I can’t even decide what I want for dinner every night let alone what I want to do for the next four years.<br />
The clock on senior year keeps ticking and as it does, senioritis just gets worse. All I want to do is graduate and get out of here, but with all the tasks needing to be done, a part of me wants the clock to tick a bit slower.<br />
If someone had asked me where I wanted to go a few weeks ago I would have a clear cut answer, but one thought about money and I’m back to square one.<br />
Maybe I’ll just wing it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Construction is finally upon us. Northwest has heard about expansion for a while now, but did not know when it was supposed to happen. Initial site work started in August while the only construction that has started is for culinary arts and the CDC. Construction crews began breaking  ground earlier this month and started working on the band room.</p>
<p>“The band area, along with the culinary arts and FACS area,” Principal Gil Alvarez said, “should just be closed for this school year.”</p>
<p>The band room will also be a safe shelter after construction, and it should be up and running by the beginning of next school year. Doors are now closed in the G hall exit, the CDC entrance to the school, and the main entrance to the gym. All students trying to get into the gym or pool for athletic events must enter from the main Tyler Street doors.</p>
<p>“The gym area will probably be closed for two years,” Alvarez said.</p>
<p>Alvarez says exits being closed will be an inconvenience but will be manageable. With the East side area being fenced off, band students will only have one exit when walking out for practice and teachers have had to relocate for new places to park. This has caused a lot of congestion in both the Tyler and 13th parking lots. Another inconvenience is some of the routes to get out of the school during drills might have changed slightly.</p>
<p>“We just ask for flexibility during the construction stages because it’s going to be a lot of things going on,” Alvarez said, “and we want to make sure we allow that flexibility during the construction so it can be completed.”</p>
<p>There will be more changes happening throughout the year which should start in October.</p>
