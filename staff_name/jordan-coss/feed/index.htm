										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, Chris Lambert took on his first year teaching at Northwest while balancing his second year coaching the Northwest baseball team.</p>
<p>Lambert teaches financial literacy, along with sports and entertainment marketing with Jeff Darr.  Before coming to Northwest, he taught for 16 years at West. </p>
<p>“I had a great experience at West,” said Lambert. “I learned a lot from the staff and I learned a lot, more importantly, from the students. But just like everything else, there comes a point in time where you’re ready to make a change and I was ready and luckily this job came open up here.”</p>
<p>As a coach, Lambert appreciates being in the same building as his players, because it allows him to watch over them more closely. </p>
<p>“Being here allows me to be in the same building as my players and that makes a difference,” said Lambert. “I think it’s important that the players see the coach in the building. They know I’m around and if they need anything I’m here, and likewise, I can find them a lot easier.”</p>
<p>Last season was Lambert’s first year coaching at Northwest, and he didn’t disappoint. He led the team to the state championship, where they took fourth out of 32 teams.<br />
The team is eager for March 2, when tryouts begin, but they know they’re going to face some challenges.  </p>
<p>“This year, led by the senior group of players that I’ve got, our expectation is to go back there and win a state title,” said Lambert. “But first we know that we have to take care of things before that, like winning the city league and then winning regionals to get us to that point. So we’re really excited about this year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Auditions for the North/Northwest collaboration of “Grease” were held in the Northwest auditorium on Aug. 21 and 22.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be a cool project,” North drama teacher Tyrone Galbreath said. “Lundin and I have been friends for a while so we thought we’d try this out and I think it’ll be kind of cool to bring two schools together and work on a project.”</p>
<p>Over 100 kids auditioned in the two day period.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>“Auditions are taking a little longer than I wanted but that’s really a good thing,” Northwest drama teacher Richard Lundin said. “That means that lots of kids are showing up.”</p>
