										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The feeling of buying something new can turn a person’s day around. After relying on this feeling for so long it can become an expensive habit. The world of a shopaholic can be a slippery slope into a ditch of denial and overspending that is hard to get out of. </p>
<p>Some Northwest students can relate to the overwhelming feeling of accomplishment when walking out of a store with more than one bag. Senior Riona Freeman knows that feeling well and now has trouble saving her money. “When I worked at a pizza place I saved a thousand dollars for a trip and now that I work in retail, I’m broke.”</p>
<p>Buying things for yourself is okay even if the total starts to add up, but spending that much every week or so may not be a good financial decision. “I like to shop at places like Forever 21 and Target,” said Sophomore Morgan Taylor, “I like to buy clothes, shoes and food.”<br />
Denial is one of the many steps to recovery.</p>
<p>“I usually get a $200 paycheck and then I spend it in like three days,” said Freeman. “I don&#8217;t really have any paychecks because I am a shopaholic, but I look good.”<br />
Acceptance is key; once realizing the initial problem of being a shopaholic, a person can move on to the next step of spending less.</p>
<p>Setting a budget is a good start to spending less and can be helpful tool in the future. There are two main tips to saving money that can be learned by taking a financial literacy class with Chris Lambert or Robin Bowman. </p>
<p>“We recommend that ten percent of each paycheck should go into savings,” Lambert said “and spend more money on your needs than your wants.”  </p>
<p>Another solution can be to set aside a certain amount of money before going shopping and only take that amount; then there’s no chance of overspending. If all else fails, you can contact Terrence Shulman, the founder of ShopaholicsAnonymous.org.</p>
