										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Northwest High School’s main priority has always been to protect their students. In the past few years, we have seen many ways this has been updated and enforced. For example, checking ID’s at football games and our recent safety feature from last year, the metal detectors. The newest addition we have is the policy that we must wear our ID’s on school lanyards while being inside of the school.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my other years of attending Northwest, you always had to receive an ID. It had a few main purposes like scanning the barcode for breakfast in the morning and giving solid proof that you were an upperclassman so you could get back into the school during lunch. Now it’s purpose is to ensure that you’re a student at the school, not a random person wandering the hallways. Continuously wearing the ID was created as a policy because of the increased amount of dangers happening inside of schools over the past few years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it can be seen as a way to keep students and staff safe inside of the school, it has proven to have many faults as well. A main issue with the new policy is the fact that if you happen to forget your ID at home one day, you must go to security and buy a new one. This can be incredibly inconvenient for some if they happen to be running late, they’d have to stand in a line to get themselves another ID. This also brings up the problem of money issues and not being able to buy yourself a new one every time you accidentally forget yours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another disadvantage with the ID system is that they can be incredibly uncomfortable which causes many disturbances. The lanyard material can scratch against your neck, or be pulled if it’s accidentally caught on something. There’s also been instances of the lanyard getting stuck in long amounts of hair, and that’s never fun to untangle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly though, the central problem regarding the ID’s is always having to wear them around our necks. Having them in our hands seems like it’d be obvious that we do go to the school. So when teachers consistently tell us in the hallway to put them on, it can seem pointless.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are quite a few things that could be taken into account to make the system easier for both parties. For instance, allowing the students the choice to bring their own type of lanyard. That could fix the issue of discomfort, seeing as you could choose your own material. Another solution could potentially be giving a little more leniency towards people who do forget their ID. Just like with tardies, you’re given a few free passes before it’s a lunch detention, that system could be tested with the IDs. So while many dislike this new policy, there’s several ways to update the conditions so that both the student body and faculty are content, and our safety is ensured.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The &#8220;Devious Licks&#8221; trend popularized on TikTok, is causing hardship for both students and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having to clean up everything that students have ruined is very difficult for all the staff. Replacing things that have been stolen takes money away that could be used for other things. Staff members say that this trend is childish and it needs to stop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is very frustrating as a school administrator to put up with the needless vandalism,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the thought of somebody putting this out there on TikTok as the devious licks trend…motivates students to vandalize their own school. We don’t have a choice but to shut them down to repair and clean up,” Principal Eric Hofer-Holdeman said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Many students are tired of the inconveniences resulting from the theft and vandalism.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I used to go to a school where we didn’t have toilet paper, soap and nothing. The fact they’re taking it away is making me a little bit uncomfortable. Some of my friends said someone stole a urinal and I didn’t understand until I saw it on tikTok and then I actually saw someone take warning signs,” Fabiola Finol-Colina (10) said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with stealing things, students are also destroying property and basic necessities. Jimmie Belden, custodian, says it makes his job harder trying to replace everything on a daily basis. Tiffany Hampe, math,&nbsp;also agrees that the trend is “ridiculous”. </span></p>
