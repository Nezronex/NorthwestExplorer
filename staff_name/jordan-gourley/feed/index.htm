										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pie Five is a pizzeria located on S. Ridge Rd, next to Lowes and Applebees; and I have to say that I was fairly impressed. The walk in was extremely similar to Chipotle’s, and the wait was just as long. Walking in, there is a long walkway towards the left and forward to the order area. i felt relaxed, the opposite feeling you get at a sports bar. I could relax, and have quiet conversation with my friend.  </p>
<p>Seating was like your typical Chipotle setup, but with more crimson, grey and white opposed to Chipotle’s maroon and brick red. The cool, calm environment gave me the opportunity to focus on my food and friend.</p>
<p>At the counter, you select how you want your pizza. From all the cheeses, different meat and vegetables toppings; the true definition of personal panned. Contrast to the stereotypical pizza, the crust here was quite doughy. The meat on it was crafted to crispiness, and the cheese melted into the sauce like ice cream in the summer. The pizza was so life changing, I had an epiphany every bite. I’d rate the pizzeria at a 4 out of 5 stars, based off of the pizza service, and restaurant comfortability. I’d definitely recommend it for anyone searching for that “next level” of pizza. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northwest Explorer: What are your goals for this season and postseason?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Martin: Raise expectations for our program. Our expectations are to make the playoffs and compete for a city league and state championship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NE: Any players we need to keep and eye on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SM: Karol Williams will have a great year at wide receiver. Kevin Folsom has been leading us on the offensive side of the ball, playing QB. Jahlyl Rounds is going to have a big year at running back. On the defensive side, Brendan Johnson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NE: Any games you’re looking forward to? Any specific teams you’re ready to face?<br />
SM: We’re looking forward to the first game against Carroll. You know we’re rivals. I’m looking forward to our district games against Dodge City and Garden City. We want to go out there and show that we can beat them. I’m personally looking forward to Hutch on Halloween. Their coach is a good friend of mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northwest Explorer: What goals do you have for this season?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ron Russell: Girls in particular I think have a chance to be one of the best&#8211;if not the best girls team we’ve ever had in 25 years. My job is helping them live up to their potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NE: Postseason?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RR: Making and placing at state. I believe we have the potential to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NE: Anything on the boys side?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RR: Boys, we’re in a rebuilding stage. Graduated 2 of our 3 runners, and then Bryce Griggs moved to Georgia. The kids we do have coming back are hard working. Many athletic sophomores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NE: Any runners we should keep an eye on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RR: Gabby Reyna, she had a great summer; Alysa Frosto? From Maize South, she’s outstanding. Just as fast as Gabby in the mile, faster in the 800. Cross country she isn’t as fast, but she’s a hard worker. Then all the returning girls, Anna Kunz, state qualifier, Madeline Keller. Great freshman girls class, probably the best ever. And that’s saying alot because we&#8217;ve had a lot of really good ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NE: Any races you’re looking forward to?<br />
RR: Southeast is where we’ll really get to show our full strength. The first two races is where we’ll get to find ourselves.</p>
