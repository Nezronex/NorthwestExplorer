										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last of the franchise. It&#8217;s finally over. Breaking Dawn Part Two, after seeing all the movies and reading all the books I think that Breaking dawn Part Two was a great way to end the series.<br />
It had a lot  of action and also a happy ending, although my only two problems with the movie was the CGI, it felt like I was watching graphics from 2001, I mean I know that Twilight makes tons of money why not have spent it on some better CGI?<br />
The other was the bad acting it was very over dramatic but only towards the beginning after they brought it more characters it got better, other than that it was a good movie.<br />
Now if you&#8217;re not a fan of Twilight I wouldn&#8217;t recommend seeing it. But if you are, you will love it.<br />
Another nice touch at the end of the movie had credits from everyone in all of the movies from the Twilight saga.<br />
I would rate the movie a 3 out of 5.  But I would honestly would wait to see it on DVD instead of in the movies because it was a good movie but not worth seeing in the theater.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you guys know me, you know that I like dress-up every other day. Well, there are lots of reasons why I like to dress up and why I think other people should dress up to school. Dressing up is a way to make myself comfortable. Most people would say heels and skirts etc., aren&#8217;t comfortable, but I&#8217;m not saying you have to wear those things.<br />
You can still dress up and be comfortable. Later in life we’re going to have to grow up and go out into the world and dress for success, we&#8217;re going to have to wear suits, ties, heels, skirts, dresses why not start now, unless you work at McDonald&#8217;s and even then you still have to wear a nice pear of khakis.<br />
Fashion is going to stay with us for the rest of our lives, it&#8217;s never going to go. There&#8217;s always going to be something new, something better and even more trendy then before. I believe that we as teenagers express ourselves in the way we dress. when you meet someone new 1st impration is everything. a 1st inpration only takes about 30 sec and to change that 1st inpretion takes about 5 min. The way you dress should be a reflection of how you feel and what kind of person you are.</p>
