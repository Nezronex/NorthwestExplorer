										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Rangel, a 17-year old Juinor from Northwest high school whose weekdays are filled with school homework, working on projects, and completing them before the deadlines hit. He is persistent when it comes to keeping his grades up and making sure he has time in his schedule to keep up with his passions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rangel explains that he doesn&#8217;t stand out in a crowd although recently he dyed his hair pink which is contrasting to his statement in which he felt that he normally doesn’t stand out. Rangel has a passion for painting and other forms of art. He picked up this passion from gaining lots of free time after his mom would not let him go outsideWeekends are filled with drawing, painting, and sewing time. Those are activities that keep him relaxed and mellowed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just became something I always loved to do and I&#8217;m still learning new ways to draw forms and shade along with finding different mediums to paint with,” Rangel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sewing is something he picked up not too long ago and it’s something that he isn’t the best at but is something that he feels passionate about. Rangel plans to continue learning new patterns and stitches. Learning how to find a steadying pattern and making himself a shirt that doesn’t fall apart at the seams is a goal he has. Activities, passions, and goals are things that keep Rangel going to help motivate him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My parents have always been impressed by my finished projects and think I can really make something out of them, they always take me out when they can if I&#8217;m in need of more supplies. ” Rangel said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases when people sign up for things, they expect them to be easy and simple and that is because of society glamorizing and only showing what people want to see. Advertisers may show the good and don’t think to mention the challenges of these activities till it’s too late, so the people watching or listening play into the challenges that it has with what’s being advertised.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some activities that may take more effort than students expect include AVID, ECA, theatre groups, book clubs, and other extracurricular activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something to keep in mind is that everything takes work. The thing to note is how much effort you’re willing to put into something to get the desired outcome. For example, you get into a program that will help you out in the long run with college but the thing you forget is the effort it takes to stay in the program. Most times people just seem to stop and give up when things get difficult because we as adults and children are told by the people with more power or knowledge that it is okay, however is not the only reason. When it comes to school, most students seem to focus better in the actual classroom. Some students end up dropping out because they don’t see a point in what they are being told to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the students are pushing themselves to make it through school even though it’s online and may be more difficult to focus. These students show everyone in the long run that no matter how tough things get, putting in the effort is important. Students who start small and build themselves up and become leaders are the people who send positive messages to the ones that are scared to start from nothing. These people are life changers in one way or another, and that’s something important to realize. Signing up and getting accepted into something thinking it is going to be easy because that’s how it seems is the wrong mindset to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into something having the wrong mindset can easily lead to failure. High school and college students tend to drop out for multiple reasons. Some learners may feel they are too far behind academically to catch up and feel as if they don’t have their teachers by their side, while others may have problems at home. Whatever the reason, many support systems exist such as counselors, after-school groups, tutoring in-school and out of school tutoring, and teachers to help students stay in school and earn diplomas or degrees; most students just won’t reach out to those support systems to know they are there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to realize what you’re signing up for and why you are doing it whether that may be for money, an education, or just for fun. People are watching you in public when you make a bold move, you could be a life-changer too.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the stress students have on them when it comes to finals, holding finals back until January just overall seems unfair. I think it’s cool that we as students are getting the chance to have a break from school, but it seems more logical to give us finals than send us on break. It doesn’t seem logical though to send us on break, then test us over everything we have learned over the semester. Most kids use their break to relax, so giving them tests when they get back from break may cause them to lose some knowledge making it to where the student body is overall more stressed out and mental health gets worse because of all the stress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting until January to take finals prolongs the semester’s stress that weighs on students. High school is meant to prepare students for the academic challenges they&#8217;ll face once they go on to college. For many teens, however, going the distance is a struggle. Students tend to get more stressed around finals because they have a mental barrier telling them they can’t do it. This commonly leads to them dropping out or letting their mental health get so bad and not reaching out for health and end up doing something like offing themselves which is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. The reasons that students end up dropping out vary–for some, it&#8217;s just a matter of poor attendance while others have to find work to support their family, it can also be common that stress is the reason why students end up dropping out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end of the semester is always a relief for students, and holding finals back delays that relief that students usually enjoy before the holidays. That refreshing moment when you have all your schoolwork done and it seems like you’re off the hook and you don’t have anything to worry about and that you’re ahead is the best feeling in the world. With a blink of an eye that feeling can go away and that stress you had before immediately comes back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking finals now, in December before the break would put a lot of stress on the students now, but giving finals after the break has the potential to send kids into overload. Some may feel unprepared because they’re been away from school for two weeks and information has been lost. Students may feel like there is nobody to reach out to because online schooling has left people feeling helpless for the main fact that we are all so distanced from each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school system is pushing so much information into our brains and it can truly be overwhelming. Reaching out to teachers tends to be difficult nowadays because they are bombarded with emails from stressed-out, overworked teenagers who just trying to get some help. Since students get so much school work their social time gets cut out and they lose some parts of themselves, this could have a serious impact on the mental health of not only the students but the people around them too. Every student may be in a different situation, some may be dealing with mental health; on the other hand, some may be dealing with family issues. The school system has been known from personal experiences and just as a generalized statement to push work down students’ throats making it to where they tend to be so overwhelmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;That saying, it’s unfair to students when they have to wait till January to take their finals because winter break is supposed to be there to relax but waiting to take finals may weigh on some leading them to not be able to relax. The school system is putting a lot of pressure on its students. It&#8217;s really unfair, young people shouldn&#8217;t have to be put through this much stress. I understand that it&#8217;s to &#8220;prepare us for adulthood&#8221; but a lot of stress is being placed on some that might not be ready for it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>In early November the United States became the first nation to see more than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases reported in a single day.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&nbsp; wide variety of people who don&#8217;t get symptoms make being out in public potentially dangerous for people With the holidays approaching, people have the urge to travel and visit family. The White House throughout the pandemic has continued to downplay the threat so people worry less, leading to numbers rising.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important Facts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers say the pandemic is responsible for roughly 1,000 fatalities per day, six times the average daily toll from the worst influenza season in the past decade</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s known that 20% to 40% of those infected are thought to be asymptomatic – they never exhibit any symptoms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel by bussing is something to avoid, they are considered high risk and are COVID transmission hot spots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking to travel, going by plane is the safest route. Planes have turbo-charged ventilation systems. Cars are also safer and an alternative when visiting people for Christmas and New Years</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of personal protective equipment remains a chronic problem, especially in hot spots for the virus</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel is risky and unsafe right now but when looking for an option to get from place to place airplanes are the safest option for public transportation. Planes have a system installed to prevent recycled air from entering the cabin and potentially exposing others to the virus.&nbsp; Several airlines also instilled strict mask-wearing mandates and some require temperature checks and negative COVID test results before allowing passengers to board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the ending of November is when Kansas got hit the worst with a total of 7,497 confirmed cases. This was confirmed on November 23. As of December, the reports of positive tests have been in the 4,000s in the area. The reason for explaining the COVID-19 scores isn&#8217;t to scare people; it is simply to spread awareness of the current crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is key to note that America’s 60 million rural residents are older. Many of these older members of the community are diagnosed with chronic health problems at higher rates than the national average. It is important to understand that these older people are considered more at risk from the virus. Getting a COVID test to make sure you are negative before seeing people will end up being the best bet for keeping yourself and other people safe. False negatives are common though, and it&#8217;s no guarantee that you or anyone you know that might be traveling aren&#8217;t contagious. No matter what precautions you take a large number of gatherings have turned into spreader events because people who tested assumed it was safe to be in a large group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about other people and not just yourself is something that has the possibility to be life-saving. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FCCLA has a national membership of over 175,000 young men and women. There are 53 state associations including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, etc. FCCLA was founded in 1945, FCCLA has involved over nine million youth. This year Sara Abrahams had made an official group for Northwest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FCCLA group participates in community service activities, last week they did an operation holiday and last year They did competitions for things. Some of their activities include personal finances, consumer rights, and responsibilities, technology, health, and safety,&nbsp; environment, and FCCLA knowledge. With COVID, all of the competitions are online this year so they are not participating in them. Anyone at Northwest has the ability to join this after school group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s shown to be more beneficial to have joined if you have FAC classes (family and consumer sciences)classes that you have taken but it’s not required. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community service is apart of the class for this program but no background checks happen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since COVID had a set-back for many students and activities the FCCLA group meets once a week after school on teams. Being in-person makes it to where there are more opportunities for students to be able to do the activities available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara Abraham is the leader of the after school program, and Jesse Hancock is the President of the program led at Northwest. Right now there are a total of eight students that are in the group. This group is also available for students of all grade levels to join.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group usually meets around 2:45 P.M. making it to where you are able to join during their advocacy hour. During the time they meet, the group discusses what they are able to do around the community. This consists of things like picking up trash, operation holiday, etc. Sara Abraham explained that since things are mostly online it has been more difficult to do activities, she also explained that most community service project that is done in larger groups have been put to a halt because of the social distancing matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fcclainc.org is the official website for the program that Sara Abraham and a couple of other students are participating in. Students who are in the after-school program have the ability to earn scholarships by the end of their senior year. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into the school year and finding out that you’re not able to go back in person can be frustrating to some, relieving to others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the original plan was for secondary students to return to school for the second nine weeks, the school board reversed that because of rising Covid-19 rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This information has felt like bad luck for some simply because, missing out on the high school experience could be disappointing for most. Especially because people talk about the high school experience being out there and life-changing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m just waiting for the day that they say we can go back to school because that will make me feel better,” Daysha Ogunbiyi, senior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogunbiyi expressed that she feels like online school is something that everyone needs to get used to. Ogunbiyi explained that as a senior this is not how she wanted to spend her last year in high school. Ogunbiyi said that she and her fellow classmates are just waiting on the day students are allowed to go back in person.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also explained that because she’s a senior she’s missing out on last dances, no first day of senior year, making new friends, visiting colleges, talking to the guidance counselors, and just having the overall high school experience for one last time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing motivation is something that can happen when you have high expectations; staying on task when at home can be extremely stressful or disruptive depending on what environment someone is in. It’s common to be able to not learn very quickly or effectively on the laptops this year because it’s still semi all-new, Ogunbiyi said when explaining that she had an easier time losing motivation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something that isn’t so good about online learning for students’ mental health is definitely the new socialization rules or ways of socializing” freshman Kylie Olsen, said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olsen said that she has heard from other students that remote schooling has a positive effect on students’ organization skills, but she has not had as much trouble with the organization as most people. Olsen said that if there was a chance where she could go back and it would be safe for everyone she would take the offer. Olsen said she believes that being in person when at school is better for her because she thinks that staying focused is less challenging. Online school may not be the most ideal citation for some but for others, it may seem to work better making it to where their motivation goes up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think online school is going well so far; It’s not ideal but we are making the best out of a bad situation.” Emmarie Nickel, Senior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickel explained in an online interview that she understands that safety is what is important, regardless of if it’s what people like or not. Nickel also said she understands the importance of getting the high school experience and getting to do activities, but in an instance where people have a chance of getting sick, it’s best to keep safe and not go out and have fun. She said missing the social aspect of the school is something that crosses her mind quite often, but regardless of this, she would continue to stay online because it’s safe and she can enjoy the comfort of her own bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olsen explained that although it is challenging to do some of the activities people might have been looking forward to this year. It is also in the best interest of the people to stay online for schooling because it lowers the likelihood of more people getting sick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Education is our passport to the future, it takes us to success and makes the people in this world life changers for some” Olsen, Freshmen.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses also offer diversity and innovation to our community, economy, as well as being able to generate a variety of products which has a huge impact. It’s not as popular to hear as much talk about small businesses in financial news, but according to the Small Business Administration, 54 percent of U.S. sales come from small businesses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since some small businesses have stepped up and closed their doors to try and help prevent the spread of COVID 19 in the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Steps Which Include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switching to carryout-only for some restaurants&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the tough decision to temporarily close</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online shopping only</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stopping sales at farmers markets to halt the possibility of getting exposed&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the cautious decision to close your doors to the public is most of the time a difficult decision to make. Over time the community created from these small businesses becomes like a family and letting that go isn’t easy. &#8216;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes a “good” teacher, or principal, or as a general statement someone who calls the shots is an open question. Some would consider a good authorizer one who doesn’t give much work while others would tend to consider one a good authorizer if they had them on their feet 24/7 and always had work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hard work makes anybody a great candidate for any profession. When a teacher works hard to get you quality material that makes them a good teacher,” freshman Mia More said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More said she believes that the main thing that makes a good teacher is their attitude and their push for motivation.&nbsp; While some new teachers,&nbsp; may tend to struggle with this, most are able to take the time to get to know their students well enough to understand what kind of workload the students can handle. However, when a teacher takes that extra mile to make sure you understand the material, that makes them outstanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A teacher that is willing to adapt to modern-day, even if they have been there for 20 years, shows that they’re willing to make the change for the better well being of the students,” freshman Elayne Logan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logan said she believes she would rather have a teacher talk about what&#8217;s in now rather than a teacher who sticks to the &#8220;old fashion&#8221; way of teaching, which doesn&#8217;t really work nowadays. Logan said that because most teachers have a stuck mindset on how teaching can be, they close themselves off to improvement and that’s what stops them from being a good teacher because they’re not willing to improve how they teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most teachers don&#8217;t really care if you actually understand, some are just trying to make it to payday. The ones who choose to stick around for so long are proven to be a good teacher,”&nbsp; More said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to differentiate between the teachers who actually teach because they want their students to learn and the teachers who teach because they’re just there for the money, More said. According to More, when you find a teacher who is genuinely concerned if you are managing the workload given, that makes them a great teacher.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each and every person has their own views on what can be considered “good” in this world but it’s your job to be able to identify why the specific thing you’re leaning toward would be considered to be a “good” thing or position.<a href="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-7206" src="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="317" srcset="https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-475x317.jpg 475w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-122x80.jpg 122w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060-120x80.jpg 120w, https://www.northwestexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DSC_0060.jpg 1501w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></a></span></p>
