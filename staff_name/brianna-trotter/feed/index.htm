										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Legislature last year presented a block grant system that left schools in Kansas’ poorer areas $54 million short. As a result, the Kansas Board of Education has had to find alternative ways to get funds to keep the school doors open. The school board is discussing cutting bus routes to trim from their current $27 million in transportation spending, but would result in making school more challenging for the students who rely on the bus for transportation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principal Gil Alvarez has already been made aware of the other potential cuts they are examining. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are programs that are [being considered to be] cut for all students whether it be JROTC, AVID, fine arts, performing arts and athletics,” Alvarez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faculty at Northwest has already planned the budget for next year and they have had to make a backup plan, just in case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we have to, we have made a 10 percent cut to our building funds,” Alvarez said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some other cuts being considered are school nurses, counselors, learning coaches, and assessment leaders. Counselor Betsy Terriere is feeling the pressure from these potential cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It not only hurts the people without jobs, but it also hurts the students because they won’t have as much to be involved in,” Terriere said. “I’m taking it a day at a time, I’m trying hard not to think about it.” </span></p>
<p><b>The Lump Sum</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many teachers in Kansas face a decision that may affect their pay through the summer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Kansas legislature fails to produce a budget the state Supreme Court considers constitutional by June 30, schools will face the threat of a statewide shutdown. In case this occurs, the school board and teacher&#8217;s union encouraged employees to take their salaries in a lump sum, instead of checks throughout the summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of 64 Northwest faculty surveyed on March 31, 82.8 percent chose to take the lump sum option, compared to only 15.6 percent who took it last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re recommending people to take [the lump sum] because people are worried that  if the state doesn’t go ahead and authorize the budget, that there will be no budget,” speech teacher Peter Crevoiserat said. “So we will be furloughed and you won’t have any money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech specialist Brian Latta is discouraged by the thought of taking a lump sum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s kind of disheartening talking about shutting down schools,” Latta said. “You’d get your money from what they already owe you, but if they shut down schools [students] wouldn’t be going to school and I wouldn’t be going to work. That’s obviously a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Crevoiserat will stick to his usual pay schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “No, I don’t plan to take it,” Crevoiserat said. “I’ve heard the rumors that it would be ‘prudent to do so.’”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas is not new the media spotlight regarding issues on education spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ten years ago was all about creation versus evolution and intelligent design,” Crevoiserat said. “They had to put stickers on science books saying ‘Evolution is just a theory,’ and the national news was like ‘Kansas, where your science book comes with a sticker.’ So we’ve always been known for having cuckoo stuff, it just comes with the territory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crevoiserat recognizes that Gov. Sam Brownback is just like any other politician, meaning he’s under a lot of scrutiny. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think he’s a bad guy,” Crevoiserat said. “I think he’s made some decisions that have gotten him a lot of scorn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latta thinks differently.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[We need a] new governor,” Latta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a new governor, though, some teachers are thinking of leaving the state and possibly the profession. Crevoiserat says he is staying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a Kansas person [and I] don’t plan on leaving,” Crevoiserat said. “I heard of the people in Missouri putting up signs saying ‘Come work for us’. I don’t even know anybody who would want to drive to Missouri.”   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latta can understand why teachers might consider a new location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think any honest educator is looking to leave Kansas for more pay,” he said. “It’s more about being treated fairly and feeling like they matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the rumors escalate the reality for a teacher continues to become scarier by the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are out of control,” Latta said. “It’s probably going to get worse before it gets better.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Why didn’t you box out?” “Why didn’t you run faster?” “why can’t you do things right the first time?” These questions are questions that I have heard my entire life. These are the degrading words that truly make me ask myself, ‘why am I still here, if I’m not wanted’? And for me these experiences have only happened with coaches, which brings me to ask the question-How far will a coach really go to get their team to the top? A lot apparently, now not every coach is like this, there are those significant few that see the game as it truly is, a sport to have fun and really learn what it means to be a team. But for others all they see is that prize at the end of the road and they will do anything to get that prize for themselves. Selfish much?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">     One of the major aspects many coaches use to ‘motivate’ their team, is putting fear in their players and making them feel neglected. While this may seem like a reasonable tactic for one player, you get a completely different result from another. The feeling of neglect is one of the worst feelings a person can experience, no matter how hard a shell a person has. It has a way of getting to a person when someone flat out tells them all of their flaws and that they aren’t worth it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">     Another thing I hate is how coaches have this singular mindset that winning is the only thing that matters and that if they don’t win, then it&#8217;s the end of the world. This was the main reason why I quit basketball, because instead of making fun and learning from my mistakes the main priorities, they chose winning over everything. I truly believe that coaches and mentors mean well, but if  they lead with  negative attitudes then that can only result to a negative outlook to everything for a student or player that does not learn that way.The beauty of all people is the fact that everybody is different, there are some that can take rough criticism very well, and then there are some like me that don’t take criticism lightly and would rather die than hear a coach scream at them all of the things that I did wrong whether they knew it or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">    At the end of the day I just believe that there moments that need this kind of motivation, and then there are moments that don’t. And I strongly believe that the attitude a person leads is the line between a great coach and a really bad one. </span>So if you&#8217;re at the point of breaking really ask yourself, is this really worth it, and if it’s not ,then I think it’s time to move on and find that thing that truly makes you smile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple weeks ago I had the opportunity to go to the beautiful city of Chicago. The reasoning for my visit was to tour the wonderful school of “Columbia College of Chicago”, which is a Performing Arts College. After touring the school and falling even deeper in love with it I had the freedom to tour the Dazzling city of Chicago. I explored the city and got to expand my horizons by riding on the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) which is only one of the several ways to travel across the city. While traveling on the train, my first stop was at Randolph/Wabash which was at the heart of Chicago. There I toured Columbia and walked, and walked some more, and kept walking. And that was pretty much my first day.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day my dad and I rented a car and went down S. Lake Shore Drive, where you can find Lake Michigan, the Buckingham Fountain, Soldier Field, and the Shedd Aquarium. After we passed all of those significant places we went to my favorite place of the entire trip, N. State Street. I instantly fell in love with the area when I saw the beautiful bungalows and the beautiful fall trees, I found the  beauty of life in that very moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we continued our trip we saw the Trump building and Chicago in it&#8217;s natural state, from the graffiti to their very tall buildings. Chicago is truly a beautiful city and I highly recommend it for vacation if you love the busy city life and lively culture. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I drive down 21st Street for the thousandth time I see something different, an emergency vehicle that says “Emergency Donut Vehicle” right in front of an up and coming donut shop. I will admit I was really excited to know that there is finally a donut shop on the west side. And what I predict to be a really cool hangout place. </span></p>
<p>As I went in I immediately felt the vibe of relaxation hit me. The lights were dark and there were tables and chairs everywhere. It had a bit of a hipster vibe and reminded me of the Donut Whole downtown. Once I took in the scenery I noticed the line was long with people anxiously waiting for their donuts.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my time was slowly approaching, I observed the wide array of donuts Hurts had to offer. From  simple glazed donuts to more complicated ones like Andes Mint donuts and more. And the best part is they are really inexpensive, the glazed ones are $1 a piece and the more complicated ones are $3 at the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my time came I got the Cookies and Cream one and it was truly amazing, who knew that Cookies and Cream and donuts would be such a good combination? Since I first went I have gone two more times and I can promise that those two times are not the last times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would recommend this place to anyone who loves donuts and who is looking for a cool place to hang out after school or on the weekends. So if you’re craving something after school or just for a quick snack, Hurts Donuts is the place to go.</span></p>
