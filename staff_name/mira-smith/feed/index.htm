										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The drama department will be having a Vendor Sale this Saturday, it will take place from 9am to 3pm in the commons.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is being organized by Vickie Nevins through Wichita All Biz as a fund raiser for the Drama Department,&#8221; said Drama teacher Richard Lundin. &#8220;Drama students and volunteers from the Performing Arts Booster Club will be participating as helpers to keep the event moving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vendors pay to have a booth to sell their items.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the third vendor’s fair to occur at Northwest this year,&#8221; said Lundin. &#8220;Exactly which vendors will be there is uncertain.  The last count had 105 businesses who had responded to the invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course factors such as weather impact who will show up in the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be local authors doing book signings, food trucks, a Zumba demonstration, and much more,&#8221; said Lundin.</p>
<p>This is their first time trying an event like this.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; we are still not 100% sure of what to expect,&#8221; said Lundin. &#8220;We are very excited but a little nervous at the same time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Northwest Fine Arts participated in an art showcase last weekend at Exploration Place. The Art teachers Andrea Corcoran, Michelle Jeffries, Tiffany Johnson, Craig Klinedinst and Drama teacher Richard Lundin teamed up with Choir teacher Amy Brown to show what their students had to offer.  </p>
<p>&#8220;What we hoped to gain form the Fine Arts showcase was exposure for our Northwest student artists,&#8221; Jeffries said. &#8220;The feeling of showing your work for others to enjoy is more than a small portion of why an artist creates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeffries says this was a great way to allow students to communicate their thoughts, feelings and ideas.</p>
<p>&#8220;This venue was free,” Jeffries said, “which was a great community connection on the part of Exploration Place. We hope to return to this same site next year.”</p>
<p>Exploration Place kept the entry fees. The Northwest students were the ones who inspired this event to take place.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a working artist I know the importance of being able to share your work,” said Jeffries, “each student who participated was allowed a chance to get their visual voice out there.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They’re slick, icy, snowy, and dangerous. Tatum Sturdivant and her father know first hand that winter roads are a common obstacle drivers have.</p>
<p>“My father and I were leaving Goodwill on Central and he turned into a back road,” Sturdivant said. “As we approached [a] stop sign, there was a huge patch of ice on the road.”</p>
<p>It was 11:30 in the morning on Dec. 8. The roads were icy from the six-degree night they had before.</p>
<p>“My dad tried stopping but he couldn’t,” Sturdivant said. “And then he was like freaking out and then a car was coming towards us while we were sliding on the road into traffic.”</p>
<p>She was worried no one would be able to contact her brother when it was over.</p>
<p>“Then my dad pushed on the gas and we were alive,” Sturdivant said. “But the other truck flipped us off, rolled down the window and cussed us out.”</p>
<p>Tatum was relieved when it was over because she knew she could see her brother and the rest of her family again.</p>
<p>A lot of people have been in a situation like this. To keep from getting in a jam during potentially dangerous driving conditions:</p>
<p>Keep an &#8216;In case of emergency&#8217; kit in your car. Some things to have in your kit are, a blanket, hand warmers, extra gloves, a small shovel, and cat litter (to give your tires extra traction if you get stuck in the snow). Also it&#8217;s good to have a jug of water and maybe some granola bars in case you get stranded, a first-aid kit, flares, jumper cables, de-icing spray, flashlight, pocket knife, and some way to call for help, like a cell phone or pager.</p>
<p>Make sure your windshield wipers are in good wiping condition. Rain or snow can build up on your windshield and can cause an obstruction of your view.</p>
<p>Reduce your driving speed. When roads are icy your tires aren&#8217;t in full contact with the road, causing less traction and ultimately causing you to slide and lose control.</p>
<p>Keep more space than usual between you and the cars around you. Following the four to ten second rule should provide sufficient amount of time for you to slow down in time, depending on your speed.</p>
<p>Keep your vehicle well ventilated. The car heater turned up full can quickly make you drowsy.</p>
<p>If you get stuck in snow do not rev your engine to try to power out of the rut. It will just make the rut worse. Instead, move your vehicle slowly backwards and forwards out of the rut using the highest gear you can. If this doesn&#8217;t work, you may have to ask for a push from a person passing or get your shovel out.</p>
<p>Fog tends to happen more during winter or summer. It happens when the air rapidly cools, causing condensation to form. It can block your view of the road and things around you; it also muffles and distorts sound. So when driving in fog take extra care and use low beam headlights.</p>
<p>When winds are strong, hold on. Winds can cause your car to sway if you aren&#8217;t careful. So hold on to your steering wheel nice and tight and keep your eyes on the road, as usual, to keep from steering off the road or losing control.</p>
<p>If you follow these tips your drive should be safe and successful. If you should get into a scary situation, the most important thing is to not panic and keep warm.</p>
