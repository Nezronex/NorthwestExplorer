										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leo Larson is a senior at Northwest High School. Larson, since a child, has always been involved in performing arts. He started performing when he was eight years old and eventually started acting in numerous children&#8217;s theatre productions. Since then, Larson has evolved in the world of theatre and has been in many playwrights/shows in the drama department at Northwest High School. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leo recently hit a milestone in his performing arts career by directing and producing his own play at Newman University. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Buffalo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the show that Larson put on at Newman University, which sold out the first night of being shown. When asked where he got his love for the arts Larson responded “I&#8217;ve always liked storytelling so I think that that drew me to some type of artistic median.”&nbsp; Currently, Leo is casted in the show </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prodigal Son</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, being put on at Northwest High School September 3rd, 4th, and 5th.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever wonder what it’s like to have lived in different countries? Well, some people have done it, even young people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Northwest High School Senior, Gabe Perez is from Ecuador, which is famous for its climate and natural regions. Perez was born in Ecuador Guayaquil, on May 7, 2004 and moved to the United States in 2012. Perez’s mother moved them to the United States for a better future and chose to settle in Kansas because that is where his stepfather was.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabe and his family still celebrate traditions they would back home including Dia De Los Muertos, also known as The Day of The Dead. Beginning Sunday, October 31and ending Tuesday, November 2, Di</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a De Los Muertos </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">honors the dead with festivals and lively celebrations, a typically Latin American custom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Some of the key differences of living in Ecuador from the U.S were “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The streets are extremely busy, You have to wear uniforms for school. Things are a lot more expensive because the economy is bad there. The police service is not as good as the U.S.” (Perez) Gabe is Bilingual and can speak both Spanish and English. He plans to go visit Ecuador this summer with his family since the last time he was there was in 2016.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I miss My family and the weather because it was always warm.” (Perez) Gabe prefers living in the United States over Ecuador Although, he is fond of both countries because one is his past and the other is his future.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest high school’s extracurricular activities, sports, and clubs have been seen a little differently as other schools in the district due to the recent coronavirus pandemic. Northwest high school has recently been continuing with certain clubs and sports, one of those including Scholars Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Scholar’s bowl team has been practicing remotely, although originally, they were practicing in school face to face social distancing, wearing masks, and sanitizing their hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[T]he season started very late for us, as schools whose tournaments we typically attend were postponing competitions to learn how to conduct online tournaments,” team coach Shawn Wingfield said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of all competing remotely at home, the scholars bowl team collectively decided it was best to meet at school and compete online as a team. They most recently competed in a virtual Scholars Bowl tournament hosted by Garden City on December 8th. They competed in a pool with five schools. With the top two schools advancing to quarter-finals. Northwest was in a three-way tie with a&nbsp; 3-1 record after preliminary rounds and missed advancing on the second tiebreaker.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this not being a normal school year parents were not allowed to come watch their child compete for safety reasons.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That being said, City League, Regionals and State will all be in-person competitions.&nbsp; We would love for parents to join us,” Winfield said. &nbsp; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have ever wanted to learn how to build or fix airplanes Northwest High School and WSU tech offer a class called Aviation Maintenance in which a student in high school can earn an Airplane Mechanics Certificate (AMP). “&#8230;Aviation Maintenance is a three year course and right now we’re in general which takes a year which just teaches us the general basics of aviation mechanics…” (Leeroy Canales, Northwest senior).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canales signed up for this class for a very logical reason. It&#8217;s a path to financial security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m taking the class because airplane mechanics get paid a lot of money and it was something that Northwest offered me for free that I could start, so I took that opportunity.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The class can lead to a well paid career in airplane mechanics. Although college is not required to obtain an AMP, you can still earn college credit through WSU tech for the course.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canales said that if a student wants to apply, he or she just needs to go to a meeting and fill out some paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[A}around the end of every school year WSU tech will give an assembly for upcoming juniors and seniors that gives you information on all their classes and they give out enrollment sheets and as long as you meet all the requirements and turn in the paper before the class is filled up they will let you in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the program that Canales takes, the class is located at the aviation training center up in Belair. “The class is three hours long and you can leave whenever you want, it’s not like high school,” Canales said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High School students who are looking for careers can keep airplane mechanics as one of the many options through&nbsp; WSU tech and Northwest.&nbsp;</span></p>
