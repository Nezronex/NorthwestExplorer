										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 8 seniors were suspended for what they called a senior prank, many are looking for answers as to what can and can’t be done. Senior pranks are glorified but never actually carried out because seniors are left wondering where punishment will be doled out. With the recent altercations, the question about suspension hangs over every seniors head. Administration heads have different opinions over how seniors should handle senior pranks.</p>
<p>Senior principal Walter Givens thinks that senior pranks are a thing of the past.<br />
“That stuff is kind of old, like people taking others mascots and stuff like that. In this era, I think its time to move on from those,” Givens said. “It’s time to think of something more positive to showcase your school pride.”</p>
<p>Principal Gil Alvarez is more concerned with the prank being appropriate.<br />
“You know, we don’t want windows broken, we don’t want stuff on doorknobs, something that would cause someone to get sick, stuff like that,” Alvarez said. “It’s been in good fun because the planning part of it has been a collaborative effort.”</p>
<p>Alvarez suggests seniors plan ahead with administration for the best possible results.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the intent could be in good fun but the reality is, it’s not welcomed when someone has to clean it up or it costs money to do so,” Alvarez said. “There is a fine line between the idea that it’s all in good fun versus the end result. I would ask somebody that has ideas to talk to administration about if it would be considered good fun and being able to find out where we draw the line.”</p>
<p>As long as there is no specific group being victimized, no serious harm being done, and proper communication, seniors have every right to go ahead with a senior prank.<br />
“The more transparent as possible, both sides working together, the better it is,” Alvarez said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The English department at Northwest High School has shown a growing concern with the lack of English groundwork students are prepared with before entering high school. The biggest concern is what language skills students are taking from their English classes. The English pacing guide does not require teachers at the high school level to teach any language skills, such as grammar and punctuation. At the college level, basic English knowledge and grammar skills are essential. It is crucial that students leave Northwest knowing the fundamental elements of grammar and punctuation.</p>
<p>Mary Liebl, Literacy Curriculum Coach for Wichita Public Schools, comments on the preparation before the high school level. She says the language skills are taught at the elementary level and reinforced throughout middle school. The middle schools equivalent to a pacing guide is not as explicit with the expectations of grammar and punctuation skills, but in the upcoming years the guide will be changed to have more specific guidelines so students are better prepared. All teachers are expected to prepare their students for the expectations of high school, but how they achieve this has been flexible in past years. This, along with lack of time and extensive curriculum, has put the language abilities of incoming students at a disadvantage. </p>
<p>Individual teachers have set out to curve this problem by adding grammar and punctuation lessons into their already packed schedules.<br />
“As a department, we are working to balance the requirements of the common core curriculum demands set upon us by testing and finding ways, and time, to incorporate pieces of grammar that are the most useful and will have the most positive impact on our students as they head off to college and careers,” English teacher Melissa Buteyn said.</p>
<p>Tim Hatfield has also put solid effort into teaching his students the proper skills, such a grammar and diagraming, that they need to leave Northwest prepared for the challenges of college level courses. He has a unique concept on why we neglect to further solidify the foundations of language throughout high school.</p>
<p>“There’s been a thought over the last 30 years that people can just learn how to read and write by just doing, and I agree with that except that it’s like saying you can throw a basketball onto a basketball court and tell a bunch of people to figure out the basketball game,” Hatfield said. “So yeah, it eventually happens and some people come up with a game that’s really similar to basketball, if not the same, but others never quite figure it out. Grammar and those types of things are just foundational that help you bridge that gap more quickly, so I try to incorporate it if I can. If I ruled the world, I would have grammar classes and reading classes and writing classes but, since we have to do it all at one time, we just do what we can.”</p>
<p>The mechanics of writing are important to prepare our students for life outside of our school walls.</p>
<p>“It make me feel like Wichita students are not going to be equipped to compete with students in other districts who do have a grammar curriculum,” Buteyn said. “I want you to leave my classroom, this high school, ready to compete and if you don’t know what a verb is, and you don’t know how to write a complete sentence because you don’t know what a verb is, you’re at a disadvantage.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a 90’s kid is one of the most fought over claims in today’s teens. Everyone wants to hold the title “90’s kid” weather they actually remember all of the greatness of the 90’s or not. It has become a touchy subject because some kids know some of the landmarks of the era, but the sincere 90’s kids know its not about the material greatness that came, it’s about the culture.<br />
Don’t get me wrong, the boy bands and the toys that broke your ankles played a large part of the 90’s. The world was just starting to realize its potential. Video games and tv shows were at their turning points and the toys were not high tech but they got the job done. Cartoons ruled the world and had so much character you never knew what was coming.<br />
In the end though, that’s not what made the 90’s great. The reason true 90’s kids brag about it so much is because we revel in the culture lost to other generations. The 90’s were about waking up on Saturday morning to watch cartoons and being outside with your friends gushing about the new Backstreet Boys song. The 90’s were about the new designs of a teen magazines and the craze over the pop scene. It was about Pokemon and the Game Boy Color.<br />
It was a simpler time where the world was growing, and we got to grow with it.<br />
When we were kids, we played outside and hung out with our friends and lived life worry, and technology, free. The computer scene wasn’t big and the video games we did have didn’t rule our lives. We were around for the start of technology, and we learned it as it came out.<br />
But as 10-year-olds, we did not have the brand new iphone. Instead, we still threw a fit when no one rewound the VHS after they watched the movie and carried around our portable cd players.<br />
It was a simpler time, and our childhood was filled with goodnatured fun.<br />
As technology found self knowledge and grew, we learned how to use it but not rely on it.<br />
The 90’s was a great time to be a kid, and it is sad that the culture is lost to generations even in our high school.<br />
The last of the 90’s kids are graduating, or will be shortly, and with us the culture and spunk we all carry with us, ingrained into our brains since our childhood, also leaves the scene.<br />
The 90’s raised us, and the culture seeps out our pores in everything we do. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I Stay, a film starring Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley, is an unconventional love story about a cellist and a rock star whose love is put under strain by a life disaster. Mia (Chloe Grace) and her family were in a brutal car crash that left her in a coma and the rest of her family dead. The movie is based off the idea that your destiny is what you choose. She is able to hear and see everything that goes on around her unresponsive body, and is left to make the choice to move on or to stay alive.<br />
The movie was based off of the novel by Gayle Forman, and stuck closely to the plot of the book. Since If I Stay is one of my favorite books, I rushed to see it in film. There’s something about seeing the emotion play out on screen that hits you harder than any printed words could. This movie shows the raw emotion of family, friends, and personal struggles that come from a major life change, such as death. The sorrow and passion hits you like a brick to the face. If you go see this movie and have anything short of a heart of ice, you will be in tears. If you are anything like me, you will need a life jacket to swim out of your tears.<br />
This movie is a must see for the season. Whether you are in need of a good cry, or just want to torture your sappy significant other, this movie will give you your sentimental fix. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one knows how another person lives until they walk a day in their shoes. I had the opportunity to do this, literally. My wardrobe was one of the many adjustments I had to make for shadowing at Bishop Carroll (BC).<br />
First and foremost, school uniforms aren’t as bad as they seem. It is nice to know what you are putting on each day without a single thought. They are also strangely comfortable. Almost everyone at BC wears Sperrys, as they fit into the strict dress code. At BC, there are no tattoos, piercings, long hair cuts (for guys), or any personalization allowed outside of designated spirit days. On game days, the boys are allowed to choose whatever tie or bowtie they want, as long as it is school appropriate.<br />
Carroll was also very undiverse. The number of non-white people was drastically less than at Northwest. It was shocking to be in a school where most of the classes I attended held only white people. Everyone I encountered was very nice, although several Carroll students commented that I may have mistaken fakeness for niceness. Even the teachers were very open and friendly towards me.<br />
The students seem much more connected as a student body there. Everyone seemed to know everyone, and even if someone didn’t like another person, they were still kind to each other. Although our student body doesn’t seem as connected as theirs, we seem to have closer relationships to our teachers. We get to know our teachers and build a mutual understanding of each others’ quirks and form an bond. Most of the students and teachers at Carroll did not seem to interact in the way we interact with our teachers. They are viewed more as strictly a teacher rather than an adult we not only respect and listen to, but can confide in and joke with.<br />
The main difference, as expected, was the religion everywhere you looked. I am a firm believer that religion and school should be separate, so this alone was a culture shock to me. There was praying in every other class, each unique in their own way. They have a religions class that is about the beliefs of the Catholic church. This class was especially hard for me, because my views are inherently different than any religion they affiliate with. I had to bite my tongue and remind myself to always be respectful when presented with views that contradicted my own.<br />
We visited during a Eucharistic Festival, an event where the Eucharist is placed in the middle of the gym and students kneeled and worshiped on carpet mats. There were a few prayers, a few songs, and a lot of time spent self-reflecting in silence. I have never witnessed a gym full of an entire school be completely silent, and that shows the respect these kids have for their religion. Many spent the entire hour of the festival on their knees, and some shed tears from being so touched.<br />
I walked a day in someone else’s Sperrys, and I have learned the everyday life of Catholic school, and as much as I respect the religion and values of the school, I prefer to spend my days at Northwest in my own checkered Vans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ALS ice bucket challenge has been the latest viral trend, spreading awareness and shivering bodies around the world. The gist of the ice bucket challenge is to either donate $100 to ALS research or only donate $10 along with dumping a bucket of ice water onto your head. Many people throughout our school have accepted the challenge, but very few actually know what the disease is.</p>
<p>According to alsa.org, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a degenerative muscle disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The disease attacks the motor neurons, and slowly makes it impossible to initiate and control muscle movement by stopping the impulses sent to tell muscle fibers to move. This results in the muscles becoming weak and smaller, since they are starving from their motor impulse diet. The muscles that are affected control voluntary movements and muscle power, so any movement that you tell your brain to make you do is hindered.</p>
<p>Imagine a life without being able to reach for your morning cup of coffee, no matter how hard you grasp.</p>
<p>Imagine a life where you can’t take a deep breath of your surroundings, no matter how hard you gasp.</p>
<p>Imagine a life where you were unable to stop or start your muscles, no matter how hard you try.</p>
<p>There is no definite reason that can explain why these signals are cut off from the muscles, and there is no cure that can halt or reverse the symptoms of ALS. There are some experimental drugs, therapies, and devices that can help manage the symptoms, but the outcome is always the same. The disease ultimately leads to death.</p>
<p>Around 5,600 people in the United States are diagnosed with ALS each year, and the life expectancy is only 2 to 5 years after diagnosis. ALS is not a biased disease, it will attack anyone at any time. There is no racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic perimeters.</p>
<p>Individuals with ALS made the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge popular, and it is very influential in the ALS community. All of the proceeds are donated to different researches, along with services that help offer education, awareness, and care services for people that are affected with ALS.</p>
<p>When you dump a bucket of freezing water on your head and donate the $10 rather than $100, you are helping save the individuals who struggle daily with ALS. You are helping in the race against time for a way to stop the disease. You are making a difference.</p>
