										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Ashton Latta wants to make you laugh, even if that means playing the same joke 20 (or 30, or 40) times. He plans on being married by the time he’s 25, a father at 30, and a grandfather at 50. Even though his father is a Wildcat fan, Ashton supports the Jayhawks. He performs academically at the same level as, or even above, his fellow 7th grade classmates.</p>
<p class="p3">Ashton also has autism, which prevents him from being able to communicate effectively. He can answer questions that require one word answers but can’t respond to open ended questions. Ashton has never been able to hold a “typical” conversation with anyone.</p>
<p class="p3">It pains his father and Site Technology Specialist Brian Latta to see his son unable to verbally express himself because of his social impairment.</p>
<p class="p3">“He wants to communicate, he wants to tell us about his day, he wants to have friends,” Brian said. “He wants to do all of those things, but he knows his disability is going to hold him back from those and he gets anxious and upset.”</p>
<p class="p3">Brian sometimes finds it difficult to understand why Ashton feels anxious or upset since he can only give one word explanations.</p>
<p class="p3">“My wife has the patience of Job,” Brian said. “She’s amazing so she never really gets frustrated with him. It’s really hard for me because I want to sit there and talk to him and have a conversation like we’re having.”</p>
<p class="p3">While he still can’t have a conversation in this way, Ashton has recently discovered an alternative that has changed his family’s lives: Brian is now able to effectively communicate with his son for the first time in 13 years via email.</p>
<p class="p3">“He’s in a computer class so that’s how he’s able to email me, my father, his grandfather, and my wife, his mom,” Brian said. “He’s able to email us every day about his day.”</p>
<p class="p3">Shari Luebbe, structured learning teacher at Maize South Middle, has set higher expectations for Ashton than previous teachers and has been patient while he reaches them. Brian credits her strategy for many opportunities that are opening up for his son, including making friends for the first time.</p>
<p class="p3">“Any students that maybe aren’t following the general curriculum but they need a voice, that’s our job,” Luebbe said. “That’s our job to figure out what’s needed and what we can do. You always look at a student’s strengths and then you go from there: how can we channel that?”</p>
<p class="p3">Autism is characterized by impaired social interaction, which has prevented Ashton from forming many relationships in the past. This became evident as early as when Ashton was eight months old.</p>
<p class="p3">“He wouldn’t crawl, he wouldn’t reach, he didn’t want to be held, he didn’t really want to be touched,” Brian said. “If you put a toy out in front of him he wouldn’t reach out and grab it. He just showed no signs of connecting with either his mother or I.”</p>
<p class="p3">With help from the structured learning staff at Maize South, though, Ashton has been able to form more relationships than ever before.</p>
<p class="p3">“He keeps everything lively and happy,” para Kristen Brown said. “He’s pretty social. He loves being around the other students. He loves to gives pats on the back, high fives.”</p>
<p class="p3">Brian hopes that every child with disabilities discovers their own way to thrive.</p>
<p class="p3">“I see it here at school, I see it everywhere where kids are really smart,” Brian said. “It’s just a matter of finding a way of getting it out of them. And that’s what great teachers do. They find a way to open them up and allow them to learn and be a part of the school. That’s what Maize South has done so well for Ashton.”</p>
<p class="p3">Luebbe says the credit doesn’t belong to her&#8211;it takes a village.</p>
<p class="p3">“I can’t do my job without all of my support staff,” Luebbe said. “We can’t do our job without great parents and students, as well as other peers and administration. It’s a team effort.”</p>
<p class="p3">Madeliene Rainbolt, a structured learning para who has worked for two school years with Ashton, agrees on the importance of a supportive community. She also emphasizes the importance of changing perspectives on children with disabilities.</p>
<p class="p3">“They’re children first,” Rainbolt said. “That’s a really important thing to remember if that’s not a population that you work with all the time. A lot of people who don’t spend a lot of time with our students look at them and see the disability. It’s really important to remember that they’re human beings with dignity and feelings, strengths and weaknesses.”</p>
<p class="p3">Brian recognizes his son’s weaknesses, but he’s thrilled that Ashton is learning to manage them.</p>
<p class="p3">“He still has communication issues, that’s never going to go away. He still has anxiety issues, that’s never going to go away. But at least now he’s able to function in a school setting, and be like a normal kid with friends.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education opens eyes, frees minds, and provides voices for children who otherwise wouldn’t be heard. Some students in the Wichita area have discovered passions that have kept them out of trouble, or passions that will translate into future careers. Others are able to eat daily only because of free meals at school. The USD 259 school system has provided a “way out” for many members of the diverse community it serves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the Kansas legislature is attempting to balance their failed budget on the backs of those who make this system possible. Thanks to the new block grant funding system they’ve implemented, the district can expect up to $30 million in additional costs with $0 in additional funding for the 2017 fiscal year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district will receive flat funding because of Gov. Sam Brownback’s historical income tax cuts: individuals in the top income tax bracket have seen their rates drop by 25% and 191,000 business owners have been exempt from paying income taxes altogether. Since, Kansas has been trailing the region and the nation in nearly every measure of the economy. For example, the state’s job growth rate ranks ninth worst in the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, large budget shortfalls exist. And the Board of Education is left scrambling to complete the seemingly impossible task of cutting $30 million from their budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This could mean reducing the athletics and fine arts programs that, through scholarships, have given numerous students the chance to go to college. This could mean reducing buses, subjecting some children to 2.5 mile walks in extreme weather across potentially dangerous intersections. This could mean leaving student resource officers, counselors, nurses, and teachers searching for work&#8211;leaving students less prepared to face the challenges of a 21st century economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indisputable truth is that the state government has failed to do its job by saddling Kansas schools with budgets that are unconstitutionally inequitable. The burden of bridging funding gaps falls not on the shoulders of the elected officials who created it, but instead on those of our educators. Educators who equip us with arguably the most powerful tool we will ever receive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what changes are put in place, we are going to suffer as a result. How will students get to school if their bus route is cancelled and they don’t have a parent at home who can take them? How will first generation college students navigate the application process without the guidance of a college career coordinator? What will diabetic students do if there isn’t a nurse to administer the medication they need? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superintendents and principals, who care deeply about our success, are being cornered into making decisions that contradict everything they stand for. As long as Brownback’s income tax cuts are in place, the revenue simply won’t exist to help the education budget recover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, students in Kansas will fall farther and farther behind the rest of the nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes that are going to occur are out of our control. In our control, though, is our attitudes. Yes, some days are harder to face at school than others, but don’t take for granted the resources you’ve been afforded.Take your education seriously, it will pave the way to a prosperous future.  And if our governor has decided that we aren’t worth investing in, let’s prove him wrong. </span></p>

</style>Randy Watson, Kansas Commissioner of Education, stopped by Northwest on Feb. 17 to celebrate Career and Technical Education (CTE) month. Watson and other representatives from the Department of Education visited Machine Tools 1, taught by Bryan Jones, members of the Pro-Start program led by Alison Draut, and Jeff Darr’s Marketing Research class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watson hoped to measure how his visions of teaching both college readiness and employability skills are being carried out in the classrooms. Northwest was the place to visit in part because of the 38-40 CTE courses it offers, including 14-18 different career pathways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Oborny, Entrepreneurship Task Force (ETF) co-chair attested to the success of the business pathway at Northwest. He credits the growth of an elementary school business program, from one competition to now three competitions, to Northwest DECA. This initiative was led by seniors Matthew Colborn, Kyle Wegleitner, Dakota West. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DECA and Northwest High has been very helpful in developing that program and also starting to scale it,” Oborny said. “They’ve done a great job, represented their age group really well and done tremendous service to the community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draut’s Pro-Start program has achieved similar success. In her classroom, recently renovated to reflect the equipment used in real commercial restaurant facilities, students are able to earn industry-recognized certificates. Junior Nicole Shartzer was able to earn two promotions at her job thanks to the certification earned in class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neely Carson, who serves on the CTE advisory committee, says this is exactly what the CTE program hopes to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all about cultivating the next group of leaders within our industries,” Carson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principal Gil Alvarez is pleased to see the commissioner’s vision being achieved within the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you talk about college and career ready skills, employability skills, the critical thinking, the problem solving, the collaboration that you have,” Alvarez said. “It’s everything we want students to be able to do when they leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ron Weddle, director of the Wichita Manufacturing Association, understands that there is still work left to be done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think there are enough kids going into particularly the manufacturing world to meet the needs coming forward,” Weddle said. “They have the basic skill sets, they’re all great with their fingers and their iPads. That’s the factory of the future. We just need to make sure they understand how to use those skill sets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest’s CTE program is moving toward doing just that, which is very important in Carson’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to prepare kids for the next step in life,” Carson said. “We have to get them ready to enter the workforce.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The yearbook staff received the All-Kansas Yearbook award for the 2015 Silvertip, last year’s yearbook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yearbooks were submitted at the Kansas Scholastic Press Association (KSPA) Fall Conference in September in Lawrence, and results are announced in December. The award is presented annually by the KSPA to recognize the best themes, coverage, reporting, photography and designs in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northwest was one of five 6A schools that were declared winners of the award. To adviser Rebekah Morse, this was no small feat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s recognized by people who look at these for a living and that’s pretty cool,” Morse said. “They know what good reporting looks like, good design and photography. Being recognized by people who know and yearbook is their life&#8211;that’s a big deal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This recognition is equally exciting for senior Taylor Webber, current editor-in-chief of the yearbook staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was really excited about it just because that was my first year on staff,” Webber said. “Being a part of a yearbook that just won the top award in Kansas is nice. It makes you feel like all of that hard work and effort you put into it was worth it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, many students leaders on the award-winning staff graduate before receiving their recognition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s kind of this whole delayed gratification thing,” Morse said. “They work so hard and then they find out when they’re off in college, ‘Oh, our yearbook was pretty good.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For senior Tatum Sturdivant, though, the long wait is worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It made me really happy because we put in a lot of hard work and dedication,” Sturdivant said. “It was stressful, but we did it and it paid off in the long run.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AP Euro students received a unique lecture during seventh hour on Tuesday, Nov. 10. Italian exchange student Giulia Putti and French exchange student Eloise Rech gave the class a look into what education is like in their home countries, including how the French Revolution is taught. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dennis Cox, the class’ instructor, values exposure to cultures in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think culture is an invaluable lesson,” Cox said. “That’s one of the reasons I enjoy traveling and taking students to Europe, for them to see the other cultures of the world and to see how history evolved there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putti was thrilled to have the opportunity to share about her own learning experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s the best thing ever to learn [about other cultures],” Putti said. “I think that you don’t learn only by studying books, but you learn by talking to people. So I really liked this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exchange students agreed that studying  in American schools is less challenging than European ones. In both Italy and France, admission into college all depends on one difficult test, on top of daily oral and written exams in class. Additionally, sleeping or phone use during class could result in suspension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cox is surprised by the rigor of European schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thing that amazed me is when they shared about their schooling and the demand on their education versus the demand in America,” Cox said. “Theirs is a lot more demanding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putti noted that she learned in elementary school the material currently being taught in Northwest’s Spanish four course. Nonetheless, living in the United States has been a learning experience for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I learned how people have different attitudes, and people’s tradition, their culture and how to be a member of a family,” Putti said. “It’s completely different. It’s interesting to see how people relate to each other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Holly Brown says that hearing from the exchange students was a learning experience for her as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I gained a new perspective on how they learn in Italy and France,” Brown said. “It helps me have a more widespread understanding about what’s going on around the world and not just in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putti is looking forward to giving a new perspective to another class besides Cox’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m very excited because now the teacher of government asked me if I can do a presentation about Italy,” Putti said. “I get to talk about my country. I’m very happy when someone asks me for my opinion.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future is dismal for anyone involved in a school bus collision. Now consider that prior to the accident, the victim suffered from a stroke. On top of that, the victim was elderly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophomore Liz McKinley was worried for the future of her 73-year-old grandmother, who was in the hospital for weeks after being in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were really shocked and concerned for her because she’s going on 75 now,” McKinley said. “We worried that she wouldn’t be able to go through the hospital and all the changes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grandma Edith was able to endure these changes, though. Unfortunately, the stroke and crash damaged the left side of her brain&#8211;the part of the brain that controls language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to take things slow and explain them to her,” McKinley said. “I have to be patient when talking with her because it takes her a while to say some things, to remember them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patience has become an ongoing practice for McKinley. After a couple of weeks in the intensive care unit, Grandma Edith moved in with her granddaughter, who now serves as a caregiver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I make sure she eats daily and she at least goes outside and goes for walks,” McKinley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caregiving is not always an easy task, especially due to the changes the task has brought to their relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a little off because she can’t remember things sometimes,” McKinley said. “One time she forgot my name and she couldn’t remember it. She’s not cheerful and happy like she used to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although her grandmother’s inability to recall her name or to recall how to drive has interfered with their relationship, McKinley is ultimately grateful for the time they share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was just relieved when I found out she would make it.”</span></p>
